In the present study, we report a symmetric acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A)–type aggregation-induced emission-active luminogen, which displays a sequential high-contrast fluorescence switching just by anisotropic mechanical grinding. Specifically, upon light grinding, an orange–yellow-to-blue hypsochromic mechanofluorochromic response with a distinct color contrast (change in the maximum emission wavelength, Δλem,max = 122 nm) is noticed, and the slightly ground solid exhibits a blue-to-red high-contrast (Δλem,max = 185 nm) bathochromic mechanofluorochromic conversion upon vigorous grinding. Thus, using a single luminogen developed here, we can realize wide-range (Δλem,max > 100 nm) hypso- and bathochromic fluorescence mechanochromisms simultaneously. The tricolored mechanofluorochromic phenomenon is attributed to two different morphological transitions involving crystalline-to-crystalline and crystalline-to-amorphous states. Furthermore, three information anticounterfeiting systems are developed using the luminogen presented here.",2024,Science Advances,24,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10871526', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adk5444', 'CorpusId': 267720561, 'PubMed': '38363838'}",1,"Given that achieving high-contrast tricolor emissive regulation of a single-component molecule using a single external stimulus is challenging yet highly desirable, our research aims to develop a symmetric acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structure capable of sequential high-contrast fluorescence switching through anisotropic mechanical grinding.

Despite recent advances characterizing the diversity of neutrophil states in cancer, common trajectories and mechanisms governing the ontogeny and relationship between these neutrophil states remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that immature and mature neutrophils that enter tumors undergo irreversible epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic modifications to converge into a distinct, terminally differentiated dcTRAIL-R1+ state. Reprogrammed dcTRAIL-R1+ neutrophils predominantly localize to a glycolytic and hypoxic niche at the tumor core and exert pro-angiogenic function that favors tumor growth. We found similar trajectories in neutrophils across multiple tumor types and in humans, suggesting that targeting this program may provide a means of enhancing certain cancer immunotherapies. Editor’s summary Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell population in the body. Although different types of neutrophils frequently gather in the tumor microenvironment, it is currently unclear how they might coordinate to support tumor growth. Using an experimental model of pancreatic cancer, Ng et al. report populations of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils that converged to develop into a single long-lived “T3” cell subset. T3 neutrophils prompted the growth of new blood vessels, which enhanced tumor survival in areas with low oxygen and limited nutrients. Depleting T3 neutrophils or inhibiting their angiogenic function reduced tumor growth. The researchers suggest that neutrophils could be reprogrammed within the tumor microenvironment into a single functional state, and modulation of protumoral neutrophil responses may have therapeutic potential. —Priscilla N. Kelly Reprogramming of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils drives their convergent differentiation within the tumor microenvironment. INTRODUCTION Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are rapidly recruited to affected tissues in large numbers to enact their protective function. As such, neutrophils were historically perceived as a homogeneous and transient population. Recently, however, a diverse array of neutrophil states has been reported in cancer, varying in their maturation, surface marker expression, and transcript profiles. The relationship between these neutrophil states and their organization into a unified protumoral response have yet to be elucidated, limiting the therapeutic targeting of neutrophils in cancer. RATIONALE To identify the mechanisms by which disparate neutrophil states are coordinated into a concerted protumoral response, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and ATACseq (assay for transposable chromatin sequencing) on neutrophils from various organs and tumors in a murine orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. Tumor neutrophil states identified from these analyses were validated by multiparametric flow cytometry, and spatial mapping at the RNA and protein levels were performed to reveal their localization within the pancreatic tumors. In vitro and in vivo approaches were then used to examine how the tumor environment shapes neutrophil phenotype, lifespan, and protumoral functions. RESULTS We identified three distinct neutrophil states within the tumor microenvironment, T1, T2, and T3, which were epigenetically and transcriptionally distinct from neutrophils in the bone marrow, spleen, and blood. By assessing nuclear morphology and maturation status, we determined that immature and mature neutrophils infiltrating the tumor differentiated into transitional T1 and T2 populations, respectively. T1 and T2 neutrophils underwent further reprogramming to converge into the T3 neutrophil state, which was terminally differentiated and expressed the surface marker dcTRAIL-R1. dcTRAIL-R1 up-regulation in tumor-naïve neutrophils could be induced by exposure to tumor-conditioned medium in vitro or entry into the tumor in vivo, and was accompanied by the expression of T3-specific genes. More importantly, this phenomenon was independent of their initial maturation phenotype. These findings thus underscore the capability of neutrophils to adopt a new functional phenotype, overlaying it onto their existing differentiation stage. The T3 phenotype was strongly correlated with a prolonged lifespan, with dcTRAIL-R1+ neutrophils persisting for more than 5 days within the tumor. Furthermore, T3 neutrophils were mainly localized to a unique hypoxic-glycolytic niche within the tumor, where they optimally exerted their pro-angiogenic function. This indicated that neutrophil reprogramming plays a critical role in enabling their survival under hypoxia, oxidative stress, and metabolic perturbations within the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, T3 neutrophils expressed high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor alpha (VEGFα) and substantially enhanced blood vessel formation within the tumor core, and only coinjection of T3 neutrophils with tumor cells accelerated tumor growth. Therefore, the ablation of either T3 neutrophils or VEGFα inhibits this growth enhancement. Finally, all three tumor neutrophil states were observed across mouse models and in multiple human cancers, with the T3 signature predicting poorer patient outcomes in two independent human pancreatic cancer cohorts and other solid tumor types. CONCLUSION By examining neutrophils in the context of their ontogeny, we uncovered their intrinsic flexibility in adapting to environmental signals regardless of their initial maturation stage. This implies that neutrophils infiltrating a tissue niche follow a common path, merging their different functional states into a single terminal phenotype as guided by the tissue. Within the tumor, this deterministic program likely ensures a continual supply of pro-angiogenic T3 neutrophils that fuel tumor growth. Our findings thus demonstrate how short-lived effector cells such as neutrophils effectively tailor their functions to accommodate tissue requirements, highlighting the untapped possibilities of targeting the local neutrophil response as immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils undergo convergent reprogramming into pro-angiogenic neutrophils that support tumor growth. In cancer, both immature and mature neutrophils infiltrate the tumor. After entering the tumor microenvironment, these neutrophils undergo differentiation, leading to the formation of transitional populations. Through reprogramming, these populations ultimately converge into a terminal neutrophil state. Reprogrammed neutrophils strongly express VEGFα and localize to a unique hypoxic-glycolytic niche near the tumor core. This places them in an optimal position to exert their pro-angiogenic function within hypoxic and nutrient-poor tumor regions, thereby promoting tumor growth. The emergence of tumor reprogramming reflects the adaptability of neutrophils to environmental cues, allowing them to consolidate their protumoral responses.",2024,Science,24,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adf6493', 'CorpusId': 266933731, 'PubMed': '38207030'}",1,"Given that neutrophils infiltrating the tumor microenvironment undergo significant epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic modifications to form a terminally differentiated, pro-angiogenic state, I propose investigating the potential of targeting this neutrophil reprogramming process as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. The study highlights that neutrophils, regardless of their initial maturation stage, are reprogrammed into a distinct dcTRAIL-R1+ state within tumors, which promotes tumor growth by enhancing blood vessel formation in hypoxic and nutrient-deprived areas. This conserved reprogramming trajectory across various tumor types and its correlation with poor clinical outcomes suggest that disrupting this process could enhance the efficacy of existing cancer immunotherapies. The research underscores the adaptability of neutrophils to the tumor microenvironment and suggests that modulating their responses holds significant therapeutic potential."

In this work, we report that the tunable electron transfer process (ETP) in M-SACs (M: Fe, Co, and Cu)/PMS systems is associated with the electron-donating capacity (as measured by electrophilic index) of different pollutants, which correlates well with their Fenton-like activities in M-SACs/PMS systems, thus affecting the respective contributions of ETP and radical pathways to the degradation of different pollutants.

Improvements to sensitivity have primarily relied on enhancing sequencing technology ex vivo. We sought to transiently augment the level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in a blood draw by attenuating its clearance in vivo. We report two intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw to recover more ctDNA. Our priming agents consist of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance and DNA-binding antibodies that protect cfDNA. In tumor-bearing mice, they greatly increase the recovery of ctDNA and improve the sensitivity for detecting small tumors. Editor’s summary Liquid biopsy for tumor analysis offers the potential for noninvasive access using a blood draw instead of a surgical procedure. In addition, sampling the blood can detect tumor DNA even when the location of a tumor is unknown. However, circulating tumor DNA is usually scarce, and it can be difficult to collect enough blood for adequate detection, especially in cases where tumors are small. Martin-Alonso et al. addressed this difficulty by developing two different types of priming agents that protect circulating DNA from destruction (see the Perspective by Moser and Heitzer). With these agents, more DNA remains in the bloodstream and is easier to detect even in small blood volumes. In mouse models of cancer, both approaches greatly increased the sensitivity of liquid biopsies. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw increase circulating tumor DNA recovery by 19- to 60-fold. INTRODUCTION Liquid biopsies including the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood can be used to diagnose, monitor, or molecularly profile disease. Despite the fast adoption of liquid biopsies in oncology, prenatal testing, infectious disease, and organ transplant monitoring, higher sensitivity is needed in many important clinical applications. In oncology, efforts to improve the sensitivity for detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have mostly focused on ex vivo sequencing and analysis methods. However, an intrinsic challenge is the scarcity of ctDNA in vivo, which leaves little ctDNA to be collected and analyzed. RATIONALE We hypothesized that transiently attenuating cfDNA clearance in vivo would augment the levels of ctDNA in circulation and increase the amount recovered from a blood draw. The two natural mechanisms for clearing cfDNA are uptake by liver-resident macrophages and degradation by circulating nucleases. In this work, we sought to develop two intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw that act on these mechanisms and enhance ctDNA recovery. Our priming agents comprise (i) nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance and (ii) DNA-binding monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that protect cfDNA. RESULTS We first investigated the nanoparticle priming strategy and identified a succinyl phosphoethanolamine–based liposomal agent that inhibited cfDNA uptake in vitro and transiently increased the recovery of cfDNA from blood in healthy mice. We confirmed that liposomes rapidly accumulated in the liver and that liver resident macrophages were necessary for cfDNA half-life extension. As an orthogonal strategy, we showed that DNA-binding mAbs interacted with elements of cfDNA and protected double-stranded DNA from nuclease digestion. Engineering the mAb to abrogate Fc-γ-receptor (FcγR) binding increased its persistence in circulation and the recovery of cfDNA from blood compared with that of the native mAb and an isotype control mAb in healthy mice. Using a bespoke ctDNA assay tracking 1822 tumor-specific single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in plasma samples from mouse preclinical cancer models, we demonstrated that our two orthogonal priming strategies increase the recovery of ctDNA by >10-fold, enable more complete tumor molecular profiling from ctDNA, and increase the sensitivity for detection of small tumors from <10% to >75%. CONCLUSTION By modulating cfDNA clearance in vivo, priming agents improved the sensitivity and robustness of ctDNA testing in tumor-bearing mice. Just as intravenous contrast agents have profoundly improved clinical imaging, we envision that priming agents will improve the sensitivity and utility of liquid biopsies across clinical applications. Additionally, the concept of delivering priming agents that transiently attenuate analyte clearance in vivo and boost diagnostic sensitivity may inform similar approaches to enhance the testing for other scarce biomarkers in oncology and beyond. Priming agents reduce the clearance of cfDNA and enhance the sensitivity of liquid biopsies. Priming agents transiently attenuate natural clearance mechanisms for cfDNA and consist of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance (top left) or DNA-binding antibodies that protect cfDNA from cellular uptake and enzymatic digestion (bottom left). In preclinical models, priming agents increased the half-life of cfDNA, enhanced recovery of ctDNA, and improved tumor molecular profiling from ctDNA and sensitivity of ctDNA testing (middle). We envision that priming agents could be administered 1 to 2 hours prior to a blood draw in the clinic to improve the recovery of ctDNA and boost the sensitivity of many types of liquid biopsy tests (right).",2024,Science,16,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adf2341', 'CorpusId': 267035359, 'PubMed': '38236959'}",1,"Given that liquid biopsies offer a noninvasive method for early detection and monitoring of diseases such as cancer, but are limited by the scarcity of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood, our research proposes to enhance the sensitivity of these biopsies by transiently attenuating the clearance of ctDNA in vivo.

5,56b576522e8371bdee6e21cec3be6d8e9986fa4b,Blood pressure pulsations modulate central neuronal activity via mechanosensitive ion channels,"The transmission of the heartbeat through the cerebral vascular system causes intracranial pressure pulsations. We discovered that arterial pressure pulsations can directly modulate central neuronal activity. In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, vascular pressure pulsations elicited correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer. These oscillations did not require synaptic transmission but reflected baroreceptive transduction in mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by a fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channel and modulated neuronal spiking activity. In awake animals, the heartbeat entrained the activity of a subset of olfactory bulb neurons within ~20 milliseconds. Thus, we propose that this fast, intrinsic interoceptive mechanism can modulate perception—for example, during arousal—within the olfactory bulb and possibly across various other brain areas. Editor’s summary Spontaneous slow oscillations have been described in the rat olfactory bulb local field potential, even in the absence of respiration. What is the origin of these oscillations? Jammal Salameh et al. discovered a subpopulation of neurons within the olfactory bulb that can directly sense cardiovascular pressure pulsations (see the Perspective by Hamill). The modulation of their excitability is transduced by mechanosensitive ion channels. Thus, there exists a fast pathway for the interoception of heartbeat whereby arterial pressure pulsations within the brain modulate neuronal activity. —Peter Stern Heartbeat-induced pulsations of cerebral blood vessels can directly entrain neuronal activity. INTRODUCTION Neural electrical oscillations are considered fundamental to how the brain processes information. Various modes of oscillation reflect processing in local or brain-wide networks and occur spontaneously or are associated with sensory and cognitive processing. Accumulating evidence suggests that such neural oscillations can also be modulated by the interoception of body rhythms, such as respiration or the heartbeat. Interoception is the sensing of internal body signals—as opposed to the sensory perception of the outer world—and thus informs the brain about the state of the organism. RATIONALE To investigate the mechanisms of local oscillations within a restricted network, we had developed a semi-intact preparation of the rat olfactory bulb—the first station of olfactory processing in the brain, noted for its strong oscillatory activity. In this type of reduced preparation, there is no heart, lung, or input from other brain areas, and the vasculature of the bulb is perfused with artificial blood by a peristaltic pump. This pump generates pressure pulsations within the cerebral vascular system that, in our setup, happen to fit within the physiological range of heartbeat-induced pulsations of intracranial pressure in vivo. Notably, these pump-induced mechanical pulsations were precisely followed by local electrical field oscillations that originated from mitral cells, the principal neurons of the olfactory bulb. On the basis of recent evidence for the expression of mechanosensitive ion channels in subsets of principal neurons across the brain, we then hypothesized that these neurons may be capable of directly sensing the vascular blood pressure pulsations associated with the heartbeat. RESULTS The pump-induced pressure pulsations provided an adequate stimulus for a mechanosensory transduction pathway within mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channels—most likely Piezo2—that are present in a subset of mitral cells. In many other body tissues, Piezo2 has been shown to contribute to the detection of vibrations within similar-frequency regimes. Its gating properties could well underlie the transformation of the sinusoidal waveform of the pressure stimulus into the more complex waveform of the local field oscillations observed in our preparation. Although this fast transduction pathway did not involve synaptic transmission, the vascular pressure pulsation rhythm entrained the spontaneous spiking activity of the mitral cells. Thus, the mechanosensory transduction exerted a direct modulatory influence on spike timing. Can this pathway allow the brain to sense the heartbeat in vivo? In awake mice, we found that neuronal spiking activity was in fact modulated by the heartbeat, with ~15% of olfactory bulb neurons being entrained by this rhythm, mostly within 20 ms. This effect was considerably weaker than the known coupling of neuronal activity to the respiration rhythm, which explains why it has not been observed until now. We observed similar heartbeat-induced modulations of neuronal activity also in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSION The role of interoception in brain function is one of the major challenges in current neuroscience. In humans, recent experimental evidence supports the modulation of autonomous and conscious perception and cognition by the cardiac cycle. Although this modulation is partially mediated by the classical ascending multisynaptic pathway originating from aortic baroreceptors, the present results reveal that heartbeat-induced pulsations of cerebral blood vessels can directly affect central neuronal activity through the activation of mechanosensitive channels. Although currently the function of this immediate pathway is a matter of speculation, we propose that a brain-wide network of “heartbeat sentinel neurons” mediates interoceptive modulation of cognition, mood, and autonomic status. For example, the occurrence of certain states of arousal might correlate with activation of this network. Our finding adds a fast transmission line to the interoceptive body-brain axis, whereby central neurons can feel the pulse within the brain. How neurons can feel the pulse within the brain.

Whereas early ecological ideas and classic observations suggested that stability increases with diversity, ecological theory makes the opposite prediction, leading to the long-standing “diversity-stability debate.” Here, we show that this puzzle can be resolved if growth scales as a sublinear power law with biomass (exponent <1), exhibiting a form of population self-regulation analogous to models of individual ontogeny. We show that competitive interactions among populations with sublinear growth do not lead to exclusion, as occurs with logistic growth, but instead promote stability at higher diversity. Our model realigns theory with classic observations and predicts large-scale macroecological patterns. However, it makes an unsettling prediction: Biodiversity loss may accelerate the destabilization of ecosystems. Editor’s summary Some of Earth’s most biodiverse ecosystems are also its most stable over time, yet ecological theory predicts that communities become less stable when more species co-occur. The most commonly used models of species coexistence are derived from the Lotka-Volterra model, which assumes that populations follow logistic growth patterns and that self-regulation is required to allow multiple species to stably coexist. Hatton et al. show that an alternative model with sublinear population growth provides nearly identical predictions to generalized Lotka-Volterra models at the population level but very different predictions for communities. Under the sublinear model, diversity promotes stability. This model is consistent with published population time series and macroecological scaling relationships. —Bianca Lopez Modeling population growth as sublinear instead of logistic predicts that ecological stability increases with diversity. INTRODUCTION The Earth’s tropical rainforests and coral reefs are a marvel of biodiversity and stability. For ecologists, however, they present a theoretical puzzle. Early ecologists believed species diversity to be a leading cause of ecological stability, which includes relative constancy in abundance and the ability to recover from disturbance. However, this view runs counter to classic theories and simple ecological models, such as the generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model. The GLV model, along with Robert May’s seminal results from random matrix theory, implies that diversity should instead lead to instability. Many studies have since found factors that can extend stability to more diverse competitive communities, but theory has yet to demonstrate how diversity may be the cause of stability, producing a positive diversity-stability relationship. This disconnect between theory and observation, framed as the “diversity-stability debate,” casts doubt on ecological model predictions at a time when they are most critically needed. RATIONALE Although much theory has focused on the varied ways in which species interact with each other, we focus on the nature of population growth and the way in which a species interacts with itself. Many models, including GLV, assume that populations grow exponentially at low densities and saturate at high densities, following the logistic function. However, there is evidence from time-series analysis that many populations of mammals, birds, fish, and insects tend to follow a different trajectory, one in which the growth of populations increases with density raised to a power less than one. This “sublinear” dynamic is thus similar to the widely used Bertalanffy model of individual growth through ontogeny. Here, we contrast the competitive dynamics that result under both the logistic and sublinear growth models. We then confront sublinear model predictions with several macroecological patterns, as well as observations of community recovery from disturbance. RESULTS Although logistic and sublinear growth share similar features at the population level, they lead to opposing predictions at the community level. Whereas logistic growth of populations implies that diversity begets instability, we find that sublinear growth allows the emergence of a form of collective regulation of populations, leading to community coexistence. Furthermore, increases in diversity enhance, rather than weaken, the stability of community dynamics, reversing the classic diversity-stability relation. Our results, based on mathematical analysis and simulations, are robust to a wide range of alternative assumptions and generalized modeling frameworks. We also find that the sublinear model is consistent with several well-known macroecological patterns, recovering production-biomass scaling across ecosystems, as well as the species abundance distribution, mean-variance scaling, and size-density scaling. As such, the model allows links to be drawn among distinct patterns of abundance. Finally, unlike the GLV model, but consistent with the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning literature, our model predicts that losses in biodiversity will tend to destabilize communities and lengthen their recovery time after disturbance. CONCLUSION The alarming rate of diversity loss means that ecology is in urgent need of a theoretical framework capable of making realistic predictions. We propose that the sublinear model is a viable description of population and community dynamics, drawing an intriguing parallel with individual growth dynamics. Population time series indicate that sublinear growth appears to be a more accurate model of population dynamics than the widely used logistic function. This small difference in the form of population growth allows collective regulation, reversing the theoretical diversity-stability relation predicted by decades of competition theory. Sublinear growth implies a positive diversity-stability relation, suggesting that diversity may be, in part, the cause of stability. Our results help to clarify the origin of the diversity-stability paradox, including the implicit assumptions in May’s argument. Moreover, sublinear growth recovers common patterns of production, biomass, and abundance, offering a simple and general predictive framework. Although we still lack an understanding of the mechanistic origin of sublinear growth, our model is consistent with early ecological wisdom, modern macroecology, and what is known about some of Earth’s most cherished ecosystems. From tropical rainforests to coral reefs, some of Earth’s most diverse ecosystems are also the most stable. This staggering diversity stands in opposition to ecological theory, which for decades has predicted that diversity begets instability. We show that a small difference in how population growth is formulated can reverse these classic predictions and match theory with observation.

Other organs and even specific cell types can be targeted for delivery via conjugation of small molecule ligands, antibodies, or peptides to RNA delivery nanoparticles. Moreover, the immune response to any RNA delivery nanoparticle plays a crucial role in determining efficacy. Targeting increased immunogenicity without induction of reactogenic side effects is crucial for vaccines, while minimization of immune response is important for gene therapies.

This work aims to discover natural ribozymes that behave as hydrolytic and sequence-specific DNA endonucleases, which could be repurposed as DNA manipulation tools. Focused on bacterial group II-C introns, we found that many systems without intron-encoded protein propagate multiple copies in their resident genomes. These introns, named HYdrolytic Endonucleolytic Ribozymes (HYERs), cleaved RNA, single-stranded DNA, bubbled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and plasmids in vitro. HYER1 generated dsDNA breaks in the mammalian genome. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis revealed a homodimer structure for HYER1, where each monomer contains a Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis pocket and captures DNA complementary to the target recognition site (TRS). Rational designs including TRS extension, recruiting sequence insertion, and heterodimerization yielded engineered HYERs showing improved specificity and flexibility for DNA manipulation. Editor’s summary Ribozymes are RNA-based enzymes that typically catalyze self-cleavage or splicing reactions. Liu et al. have now discovered hydrolytic endonucleolytic ribozymes (HYERs), which have the capability to precisely manipulate DNA. These ribozymes operate independently of proteins and can edit genes in both bacteria and human cells, offering a potential alternative to CRISPR and other gene-editing tools. A critical aspect of their function is that some HYERs adopt a homodimer structure that recognizes DNA through a complementary target recognition sequence and cleaves the DNA hydrolytically. Using reprogramming, the authors were able to redirect HYERs to new DNA targets, enhancing their precision and versatility. —Di Jiang Bacterial GII-C intron ribozymes are programmable and self-guided endonucleases active for sequence-specific DNA manipulation. INTRODUCTION Ribozymes play catalytic roles in diverse biochemical processes. Group II (GII) intron ribozymes are well-studied catalysts for splicing and retrotransposition with the assistance of intron-encoded proteins (IEPs) through transesterification. When IEPs are not provided, GII introns can cleave their precursor RNA targets through hydrolysis, forming mature and linearized ribozymes. These ribozymes also exhibit hydrolytic endonuclease activity on RNA or DNA-modified RNA substrates. However, substantive hydrolytic cleavage of pure DNA is rarely observed within reported intron ribozymes. These clues suggest that uncharacterized intron ribozymes encoded by “propagating” retrotransposons, especially those that naturally lack the IEP components [open reading frame (ORF)–less introns], might hold the potential to cleave pure DNA targets through hydrolysis. These hypothetical ribozymes are called HYdrolytic Endonucleolytic Ribozymes (HYERs). If available, RNA-based HYERs could be employed for gene editing, expanding the current toolbox established by protein enzymes such as TALEN and CRISPR-Cas. RATIONALE In our preliminary observation, several compact ORF-less GII-C introns show multiple copies within their resident genomes, suggesting that these introns might be active for genomic propagation including target DNA recognition and cleavage reactions. Bioinformatic mining identified many “propagating” ORF-less GII-C introns as HYER candidates. Biochemical assays confirmed HYER’s hydrolytic cleavage activity on RNA and DNA substrates. HYER was active for DNA cleavage in both bacterial and mammalian cells. Cryo–EM analysis revealed the high-resolution structure of HYER, elucidating its catalytic mechanism and providing structural insights for engineering. RESULTS Using the primary sequences and secondary structural features of core domains I to III and V to VI in reported GII-C introns, we built the covariance models for systematic mining and identified 93 HYER candidates from the public bacterial genomes. Nine candidates (HYERs 1 to 9) were rationally selected for experimental characterization. HYERs 1 to 6 exhibited sequence-specific endonuclease activity in vitro. Biochemical screening suggested that the highly active HYER1 and HYER2 are both Mg2+-dependent hydrolytic ribozymes, which cleaved the DNA targets in a broad range of biochemical conditions including various temperatures (25° to 50°C) and potassium concentrations (10 to 500 mM). Of note, HYER1 and HYER2 were active for plasmid interference in E. coli. Within the reporter cell line containing the out-of-frame puromycin gene, HYER1 could generate genomic dsDNA breaks and yield DNA insertions and deletions to restore puromycin resistance. Single particle cryo-EM analysis illustrated that HYER1 forms a C2-symmetric homodimer mediated by palindromes and A-stacking interactions between the two monomers. Each HYER1 monomer contains a 6-nucleotide (nt) target recognition site (TRS) and a hydrolytic pocket for capturing and cleaving DNA substrates. HYER2, which does not have the palindrome, exhibits monomeric architecture and contains a catalytic pocket highly identical to the monomer unit of HYER1. Full complementarity between HYER TRSs and DNA targets is essential for efficient cleavage. Revised TRSs could redirect HYERs to cleave different DNA targets. Three rational designs, which aimed to improve the DNA-targeting performance by HYER1, were explored. Extending the TRS improved HYER1’s DNA recognition specificity but decreased the cleavage activity. The insertion of a 14-nt recruiting sequence (RS), which is sequentially distant but spatially proximal to TRS, increased both the DNA recognition length and the cleavage activity by HYER1. Mutating the palindromes allowed HYER1 to form the heterodimer, which can carry two distinct TRSs and generate customizable dsDNA breaks with cleavage products bearing 5’ overhangs, blunt ends, or 3’ overhangs. CONCLUSION We discovered HYERs as sequence-specific and hydrolytic endonucleases. HYER1 showed plasmid interference activity in bacterial cells and genome-editing capability in mammalian cells. Cryo-EM analysis revealed the homodimer structure of HYER1, which captures the complementary DNA target via TRS and cleaves the target using the hydrolytic mechanism. TRS extension, RS insertion, and heterodimerization improved the specificity and flexibility of DNA targeting by HYER1. As an RNA-based DNA manipulation platform, HYER is highly programmable and holds the potential to be further developed and utilized in multiple genetic scenarios. Hydrolytic DNA cleavage by HYER1. During the DNA cleavage reaction, the DNA is captured by the TRS region of HYER1 via complementary base pairing. Then, the nucleophilic attack by the water molecule within the catalytic pocket leads to the cleavage of DNA substrate. The engineered HYER1 heterodimer, which contains two distinct TRSs, can generate various forms of dsDNA breaks.",2024,Science,8,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adh4859', 'CorpusId': 267365606, 'PubMed': '38301022'}",1,"Given that ribozymes exhibit catalytic capabilities in various biochemical processes, our research proposes to explore the potential of natural hydrolytic and sequence-specific DNA endonucleases, specifically from bacterial group II-C introns, as innovative DNA manipulation tools.

10,94b7680b2281ca2897f8ed7ea635e08eeacba911,A blueprint for tumor-infiltrating B cells across human cancers,"B lymphocytes are essential mediators of humoral immunity and play multiple roles in human cancer. To decode the functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells, we generated a B cell blueprint encompassing single-cell transcriptome, B cell–receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data across 20 different cancer types (477 samples, 269 patients). B cells harbored extraordinary heterogeneity and comprised 15 subsets, which could be grouped into two independent developmental paths (extrafollicular versus germinal center). Tumor types grouped into the extrafollicular pathway were linked with worse clinical outcomes and resistance to immunotherapy. The dysfunctional extrafollicular program was associated with glutamine-derived metabolites through epigenetic-metabolic cross-talk, which promoted a T cell–driven immunosuppressive program. These data suggest an intratumor B cell balance between extrafollicular and germinal-center responses and suggest that humoral immunity could possibly be harnessed for B cell–targeting immunotherapy. Editor’s summary B cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies and are often found within the tumor microenvironment. Ma et al. examined tumor-infiltrating B cells across 21 different cancer types from more than 270 patients (see the Perspective by Tellier and Nutt). The authors compiled single-cell transcriptome, B cell receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data and report that tumor-associated B cells differentiated into antibody-secreting cells by either an extrafollicular pathway or by a more canonical germinal center pathway. Tumors associated with the extrafollicular B cell profile demonstrated poor clinical prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy compared with tumors harboring germinal center B cells. Alterations in the availability of glutamine-derived metabolites, which are known to influence T cell–dependent immunosuppression, may be linked to a dysfunctional humoral response and the adverse effect of extrafollicular B cells on tumors. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Tumor-infiltrating B cells have emerged as important players in cancer immunity and served as predictors of response to immunotherapy. These B cells display multiple functions, primarily through their ability to differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies, but vary spatiotemporally across different cancer types. Dissecting the abundance and differentiation states of B cells across diverse cancer types holds promise for improving the immunotherapeutic response. RATIONALE To compile a comprehensive pan-cancer B cell landscape, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on paired tumors, lymph node metastases, adjacent normal tissues, and peripheral blood from patients with various cancer types, as well as incorporating substantial published scRNA-seq datasets. After correction of the batch effect, this atlas consists of scRNA-seq data from 269 patients across 20 cancer types. We assembled B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing of individual B cells with gene-expression profiles to characterize the dynamic transition between B cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). We integrated the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape of B cells from different cancers to dissect the epigenomic regulation networks that function in fine-tuning B cell development. We spatially localized B cells in mature versus immature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and investigated the potential regulators that direct B cells into specific responses. RESULTS We revealed substantial heterogeneity within B and plasma cells, identifying 15 B cell subsets and 10 plasma cell subsets. We computationally derived and validated two independent developmental pathways to ASCs through canonical germinal center (GC) and alternative extrafollicular (EF) pathways and demonstrated an apparent cancer-type preference. Colon adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma were the two representative types of cancer enriched for GC and EF pathways, respectively. We affirmed that EF-dominant cancers correlate with dysregulated immune responses and worse clinical outcomes. We then identified the dynamic metabolic-epigenetic-signaling networks engaged in fine-tuning tumor-infiltrating B cell differentiation and managing the balance between the EF and GC pathways. Atypical memory (AtM) B cells, the primary progenitors of EF-derived ASCs, exhibit an exhausted and bystander phenotype and develop independently of the GC pathway. We found that the AtM B cells reside in the center of immature TLSs and spatially relocate to the periphery during TLS maturation. Last, we mechanistically linked these findings to specific transcription factors and epigenomic regulations. We demonstrated that the glutamine-derived metabolite α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) could increase the expression of AtM B cell–associated transcription factors T-bet and BATF and promote their differentiation, accompanied by the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Consequently, AtM B cells acquire an immunoregulatory function that dampens antitumor T cell responses and fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment. CONCLUSION We compiled the blueprint of B cell heterogeneity and two dynamic differentiation pathways in human cancers, providing a fundamental reference of ASC differentiation trajectory for future studies. The systematic comparison between EF and GC pathways reveals the similarities and differences of B cell states across different cancer types, highlighting the unfavorable clinical outcome linked to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of EF pathway–associated AtM B cells. Metabolic-epigenetic networks are remarkably flexible and can reconfigure B cell fates in a way that will facilitate the development of B cell–targeted immunotherapies. Systematic analysis of a human pan-cancer B cell atlas. We analyzed 474,718 B cells from 269 patients across 20 cancer types using single-cell sequencing data. By combining gene expression profiles, BCR sequences, and chromatin accessibility, we investigated the diversity and plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B cells and performed a multilevel comparison of EF- and GC-responsive plasma cells among cancer types. We visualized their dynamic spatial locations along the maturation of TLSs and identified potential metabolic-epigenetic mechanisms in regulating B cell differentiation.",2024,Science,7,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adj4857', 'CorpusId': 269502788, 'PubMed': '38696569'}",1,"Given that B lymphocytes are pivotal in humoral immunity and display significant diversity within tumor environments, our research proposes to explore the functional and developmental heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating B cells across different cancer types.

Tumors associated with the extrafollicular pathway exhibited poorer clinical outcomes and resistance to immunotherapy, linked to glutamine-derived metabolites influencing T cell–mediated immunosuppression. Our findings suggest a balance between these B cell responses within tumors and highlight the potential for targeting specific B cell pathways to enhance immunotherapeutic strategies."

We assessed whether bursts of change in chromosome numbers resulting from chromosomal fusion or fission are related to increased speciation rates in Erebia, one of the most species-rich and karyotypically variable butterfly groups. We established a genome-based phylogeny and used state-dependent birth-death models to infer trajectories of karyotype evolution. We demonstrated that rates of anagenetic chromosomal changes (i.e., along phylogenetic branches) exceed cladogenetic changes (i.e., at speciation events), but, when cladogenetic changes occur, they are mostly associated with chromosomal fissions rather than fusions. We found that the relative importance of fusion and fission differs among Erebia clades of different ages and that especially in younger, more karyotypically diverse clades, speciation is more frequently associated with cladogenetic chromosomal changes. Overall, our results imply that chromosomal fusions and fissions have contrasting macroevolutionary roles and that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements are associated with bursts of species diversification.",2024,Science Advances,7,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11023530', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adl0989', 'CorpusId': 256033542, 'PubMed': '38630820'}",1,"Given that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, such as fusions and fissions, play a significant role in species diversification, my research aims to explore the varying macroevolutionary impacts of these chromosomal changes across different clades of a highly diverse butterfly group, Erebia.

Additionally, the research will investigate how the relative importance of fusion and fission shifts with clade age and karyotypic diversity, particularly focusing on younger clades where speciation appears more linked to chromosomal rearrangements. This study could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving speciation and the evolutionary significance of chromosomal dynamics."

However, within natural communities, we know surprisingly little about the nutritional value of plants to wild bees, and pollen nutrition has not previously been a priority when selecting plants for restoration efforts. We show that consideration of pollen macronutrient content can help explain patterns of interactions among wild bees visiting wildflowers to collect pollen, which sheds light on the nutritional basis of plant–bee mutualisms, and can help inform plans to restore bee habitat, conserve plant species, and design supplemental plantings for bees in agricultural and urban areas.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10801918', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2317228120', 'CorpusId': 266872976, 'PubMed': '38190523'}",1,"Given that the nutritional value of pollen is a critical factor in pollinator health and ecosystem stability, this research highlights the importance of considering pollen macronutrient content when selecting plants for restoration and conservation efforts.

However, the key effector(s) of AMPK and the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed that AMPK phosphorylation of the folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) serine-220 (S220) controls mitochondrial function and muscle fuel utilization during exercise. Loss of FNIP1 in skeletal muscle resulted in increased mitochondrial content and augmented metabolic capacity, leading to enhanced exercise endurance in mice. Using skeletal muscle–specific nonphosphorylatable FNIP1 (S220A) and phosphomimic (S220D) transgenic mouse models as well as biochemical analysis in primary skeletal muscle cells, we demonstrated that exercise-induced FNIP1 (S220) phosphorylation by AMPK in muscle regulates mitochondrial electron transfer chain complex assembly, fuel utilization, and exercise performance without affecting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1–transcription factor EB signaling.

They have undergone remarkable diversification throughout their evolutionary history. However, the drivers of their diversity dynamics are not well quantified or understood. Previous phylogenetic analyses have suggested patterns of diversity dynamics associated with the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution (ATR), but these studies have overlooked valuable information from the fossil record. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a large dataset that includes both the ant fossil record (~24,000 individual occurrences) and neontological data (~14,000 occurrences), and tested four hypotheses proposed for ant diversification: co-diversification, competitive extinction, hyper-specialization, and buffered extinction. Taking into account biases in the fossil record, we found three distinct diversification periods (the latest Cretaceous, Eocene, and Oligo-Miocene) and one extinction period (Late Cretaceous). The competitive extinction hypothesis between stem and crown ants is not supported. Instead, we found support for the co-diversification, buffered extinction, and hyper-specialization hypotheses. The environmental changes of the ATR, mediated by the angiosperm radiation, likely played a critical role in buffering ants against extinction and favoring their diversification by providing new ecological niches, such as forest litter and arboreal nesting sites, and additional resources. We also hypothesize that the decline and extinction of stem ants during the Late Cretaceous was due to their hyper-specialized morphology, which limited their ability to expand their dietary niche in changing environments. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach when studying the interplay between past environments and the evolutionary trajectories of organisms.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,5,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2317795121', 'CorpusId': 268361780, 'PubMed': '38466878'}",1,"Given that ants have undergone significant diversification throughout their evolutionary history, understanding the drivers of their diversity dynamics remains challenging. Our research proposes to investigate the evolutionary trajectories of ants by integrating both fossil and neontological data. We aim to test hypotheses regarding ant diversification, including co-diversification with angiosperms, competitive extinction, hyper-specialization, and buffered extinction. Our preliminary findings suggest three major diversification periods and one extinction period, with evidence supporting co-diversification, buffered extinction, and hyper-specialization hypotheses, while refuting competitive extinction. These results indicate that the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution significantly influenced ant diversification by creating new ecological niches and resources, thereby buffering against extinction. Additionally, the Late Cretaceous extinction of stem ants may be attributed to their hyper-specialized morphology, which hindered their adaptability in dynamic environments. This comprehensive approach underscores the necessity of incorporating both fossil and current data to elucidate the complex interplay between environmental changes and evolutionary processes."

Yet, sex differences and the effects of sex hormones on anesthetic sensitivity have not been systematically explored. We demonstrate that the female brain in mice and humans is resistant to the hypnotic effects of volatile anesthetics. Sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity are largely due to acute effects of sex hormones. Despite clear behavioral differences in anesthetic sensitivity, sex differences are not discernable in clinically used cortical electroencephalographic recordings. In contrast, subcortical sites exhibit sexually dimorphic activity patterns under anesthesia. This covert resistance to anesthetics may explain the higher incidence of awareness under anesthesia in females.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,5,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10801881', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2312913120', 'CorpusId': 266871159, 'PubMed': '38190526'}",1,"Given that the female brain shows resistance to the hypnotic effects of volatile anesthetics, and that sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity are primarily influenced by the acute effects of sex hormones, it is crucial to systematically investigate these differences.

However, its exact mechanism, especially that in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is unclear. In this study, the cellulase activity of the M. tuberculosis Rv0062 protein was characterized, and its effect on mycobacterial biofilm dispersal was analyzed by observation of the structure and components of Rv0062-treated biofilm in vitro. Meanwhile, the metabolite factors that induced cellulase-related biofilm dispersal were also explored with metabolome analysis and further validations. The results showed that Rv0062 protein had a cellulase activity with a similar optimum pH (6.0) and lower optimum temperature (30 °C) compared to the cellulases from other bacteria. It promoted mycobacterial biofilm dispersal by hydrolyzing cellulose, the main component of extracellular polymeric substrates of mycobacterial biofilm. A metabolome analysis revealed that 107 metabolites were significantly altered at different stages of M. smegmatis biofilm development. Among them, a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) promoted cellulase-related biofilm dispersal, and this effect was realized with the down-regulation of the bacterial signal molecule c-di-GMP. All these findings suggested that cellulase promotes mycobacterial biofilm dispersal and that this process is closely associated with biofilm metabolite alterations.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816823', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021051', 'CorpusId': 267094056, 'PubMed': '38256125'}",1,"Given that biofilm dispersal is crucial for bacterial spread and disease transmission, this study investigates the role of the Rv0062 protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

We confirm that the pre-mRNA generated from SMN2Sup undergoes splicing to produce a translation-competent mRNA. We demonstrate that mRNA generated from SMN2Sup produces more SMN than an identical mRNA generated from a cDNA clone. We uncover that overexpression of SMN triggers skipping of exon 3 of SMN1/SMN2. We define the minimal promoter and regulatory elements associated with the initiation and elongation of transcription of SMN2. The shortened introns within SMN2Sup preserved the ability of camptothecin, a transcription elongation inhibitor, to induce skipping of exons 3 and 7 of SMN2. We show that intron 1-retained transcripts undergo nonsense-mediated decay. We demonstrate that splicing factor SRSF3 and DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 regulate splicing of multiple exons in the context of both SMN2Sup and endogenous SMN1/SMN2. Prevention of SMN2 exon 7 skipping has implications for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We validate the utility of the super minigene in monitoring SMN levels upon splicing correction. Finally, we demonstrate how the super minigene could be employed to capture the cell type-specific effects of a pathogenic SMN1 mutation.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11040157', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkad1259', 'CorpusId': 266960587, 'PubMed': '38214229'}",1,"Summary: Given that the SMN2 gene plays a critical role in the pathology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), this study introduces a novel SMN2 super minigene (SMN2Sup) designed to facilitate the study of SMN2 gene regulation and splicing.

Proteins increased in AD have been reported to include fibronectin (FN) fragments 3 and 4 (FN1.3 and FN1.4, respectively) and ApoE. We hypothesized that Alzheimer-related proteins would be dysregulated in PCOS because of associated insulin resistance and obesity. In this comparative cross-sectional analysis, aptamer-based SomaScan proteomic analysis for the detection of plasma Alzheimer-related proteins was undertaken in a PCOS biobank of 143 women with PCOS and 97 control women. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) (p < 0.05) and amyloid P-component (APCS) (p < 0.001) were elevated in PCOS, while alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (p < 0.05) was reduced in PCOS. Associations with protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed that SNCA positively correlated with HSP90 (p < 0.0001) and HSP60 (p < 0.0001) in both the PCOS and control women. Correlations with markers of inflammation showed that APCS correlated with interleukin 6 (IL6) (p = 0.04), while Apolipoprotein (Apo) E3 correlated with TNF-alpha (p = 0.02). FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE were all elevated significantly (p < 0.05). An AD-associated protein pattern with elevated FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE was found in PCOS, in addition to elevated APP and reduced SNCA, which was the same as reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with, additionally, an elevation in APCS. With the AD biomarker pattern in PCOS being very similar to that in T2D, where there is an association between AD and T2D, this suggests that larger prospective cohort studies are needed in women with PCOS to determine if there is a causal association with AD.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816448', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021158', 'CorpusId': 267091824, 'PubMed': '38256230'}",1,"Given that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shares several risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including insulin resistance and obesity, this study hypothesizes that Alzheimer-related proteins may be dysregulated in women with PCOS.

However, selectively generating high-yield nonradicals from the PMS activation is often challenging. Herein, precise sulfur coordination was engineered to modulate the local microenvironment of Fe SAC, achieving both high nonradical yield and PMS utilization. Electronic and geometric effects of short-distance and long-distance S coordination were fundamentally distinguished. Short-distance S could upshift the d-band center of the Fe atom and change its bonding mode with PMS, achieving the selective and controllable generation of nonradicals, i.e., 1O2 and FeIV=O.

Two general paradigms have been proposed to explain this variation: (i) trade-offs between performance efficiency and breadth and (ii) the joint influence of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (genomic) factors. We assembled genomic, metabolic, and ecological data from nearly all known species of the ancient fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina (1154 yeast strains from 1051 species), grown in 24 different environmental conditions, to examine niche breadth evolution. We found that large differences in the breadth of carbon utilization traits between yeasts stem from intrinsic differences in genes encoding specific metabolic pathways, but we found limited evidence for trade-offs. These comprehensive data argue that intrinsic factors shape niche breadth variation in microbes. Editor’s summary Some species are highly specialized in using particular resources or live in a narrow range of environmental conditions. By contrast, generalists have broad ecological niches. The factors underlying the wide variation in niche breadth across species are largely unknown. Opulente et al. investigated whether specialists have more efficient resource use than generalists or if environmental or genomic factors shape the evolution of niche breadth. Using genomes from over 1000 species of Saccharomycotina yeasts and data on their performance growing in 24 different environments, the authors found that genes related to metabolic pathways had the clearest relationship to niche breadth. There was little support for the “ jack of all trades, master of none ” tradeoff across the subphylum. —Bianca Lopez INTRODUCTION It is often said that the jack-of-all-trades is the master of none. Niche breadth varies widely across the tree of life, from narrow in specialists to broad in generalists. One ecological paradigm explains this variation by invoking trade-offs between niche breadth and performance efficiency. Generalists perform moderately well in many niches, whereas each specialist has an advantage in its own niche. A second paradigm explains niche breadth variation through extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors are ecological variables that include nutrient availability, temperature, organism interactions, and heterogeneity. Intrinsic factors are encoded by organisms’ genomes and affect how they access and process nutrients and tolerate stresses. RATIONALE To study niche breadth macroevolution, we deployed an ancient model subphylum uniquely poised for studies at genomic, metabolic, and ecological scales. The yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina of kingdom Fungi is best known for the model baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the major human pathogen Candida albicans, but more than 1000 species have radiated during more than 400 million years into diverse ecological niches. Yeasts harbor gene sequence divergence comparable to that of animals and plants and are found in environments ranging from bats to cadaver tanks and from cheese caves to biofuel factories. RESULTS We generated a vast dataset of genome sequences of 1154 yeasts from nearly every known species, quantitative metabolic growth data in 24 conditions, and a hierarchical ecological ontology of isolation environments. Using evolutionary, machine learning, and network analyses, we found that yeast metabolic niche breadth is largely shaped by intrinsic factors. Generalist genomes encoded more genes and metabolic reactions, and our machine learning algorithm distinguished generalists from specialists using genome content with high accuracy. The most predictive features in our dataset pointed to specific genes in four pathways or complexes that are directly involved in carbon and energy metabolism, often by enhancing metabolic flexibility and robustness. Through ancestral trait reconstruction and coevolution analyses, we further demonstrated that generalists were more likely to have retained or gained traits, whereas specialists repeatedly arose through pervasive gene and trait loss. We did not find evidence for trade-offs between carbon niche breadth and growth rates; compared with specialists, carbon generalists grew faster in laboratory conditions and on more nitrogen sources. These results suggest that intrinsic genetic factors are a major driver of microbial diversity and niche breadth variation. CONCLUSION We generated a genomic, metabolic, and ecological dataset to show how metabolic diversity and niche breadth are encoded in yeast genomes and how these traits have evolved over deep time. Coupling a comprehensive dataset with a robust analytical framework paints a rich portrait of a diverse eukaryotic subphylum with immense impacts on human health, agriculture, and biotechnology that provides a roadmap connecting DNA to diversity. A comprehensive initiative capturing genomic, metabolic, and ecological diversity among 1154 yeasts of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. We built a robust phylogeny and generated extensive genomic, phenotypic, and ecological data. We identified carbon niche breadth variation and used machine leaning to identify several intrinsic factors that contribute to carbon generalism.",2024,Science,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adj4503', 'CorpusId': 269361989, 'PubMed': '38662846'}",1,"Given that niche breadth variation in organisms can be influenced by intrinsic genomic factors rather than trade-offs between performance efficiency and niche breadth, I propose to investigate the genomic determinants of niche specialization and generalism in a different microbial subphylum.

This research suggests that understanding the genomic underpinnings of niche breadth could illuminate the evolutionary mechanisms driving microbial diversity and adaptation. Therefore, I hypothesize that similar intrinsic genomic factors may play a pivotal role in determining niche breadth in other microbial groups and aim to explore this through comprehensive genomic, metabolic, and ecological analyses."

However, little is known about the relationship between dosage and performance enhancement, particularly in female athletes. This study aimed to explore the effects of three different CAF dosages (3 mg·kg−1, 6 mg·kg−1, and 9 mg·kg−1) on high-intensity exercise and the prevalence of undesirable side effects related to these doses among female team-sports athletes. All participants (n = 16; age: 16.9 ± 0.6 y; height: 1.64 ± 0.1 m; BMI: 21.6 ± 1.5 kg·m−2) were mild CAF consumers. This study had a randomized, crossover, double-blind design in which each athlete performed four experimental sessions after ingesting either a placebo (PLAC), 3 mg·kg−1 CAF (CAF-3), 6 mg·kg−1 CAF (CAF-6), or 9 mg·kg−1 of CAF (CAF-9), with an in-between washout period of at least 72 h. In each experimental session, 60 min after ingesting the capsules, participants underwent a countermovement jumps test (CMJ), modified agility t-test (MATT), repeated sprint ability (RSA) test, and a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and completed the CAF side effects questionnaire. Our findings revealed that in comparison to the PLAC condition, the MATT, RSAmean, and RSAbest performances were significantly greater only under the CAF-6 and CAF-9 conditions. Although the RPE scores remained unchanged, CMJ performance improved under all CAF conditions. All the performance outcomes were better for the CAF-6 and CAF-9 conditions than for the CAF-3 condition. Notably, no significant difference between the CAF-6 and CAF-9 conditions was observed for any of these parameters despite the highest incidence of side effects being noted for the CAF-9 condition. In summary, our findings highlight the recommendation for a moderate CAF dosage of 6 mg·kg−1 rather than 3 or 9 mg·kg−1 to enhance various aspects of short-term maximal performance in mild-CAF-consumer female team-sports athletes while mitigating the occurrence of adverse CAF side effects.",2024,Nutrients,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10935148', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16050640', 'CorpusId': 268185197, 'PubMed': '38474768'}",1,"Given that caffeine is widely studied as a dietary supplement but its dosage-related effects on performance, particularly in female athletes, remain unclear, our research aims to investigate the optimal caffeine dosage for enhancing high-intensity exercise performance while minimizing side effects in female team-sports athletes. Our findings suggest that a moderate caffeine dosage of 6 mg·kg−1 is more effective in improving agility, repeated sprint ability, and jump performance compared to lower or higher doses, without increasing perceived exertion, and avoids the higher incidence of side effects associated with the highest dose. This indicates that a 6 mg·kg−1 dose may be optimal for performance enhancement in this demographic."

It functions as a ~4-megadalton complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognize diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) protein (LIS1) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. This structure reveals the molecular basis of interactions occurring during dynein activation. We show how JIP3 activates dynein despite its atypical architecture. Unexpectedly, LIS1 binds dynactin’s p150 subunit, tethering it along the length of dynein. Our data suggest that LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation. Editor’s summary Cells transport large cargos such as organelles on microtubules through large molecular motor complexes. Assembly and regulation are essential for proper targeting and processive movement. Singh et al. determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of the dynein-dynactin molecular motor complex bound to the regulatory protein LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor protein JIP3. The latter appears as an unusually short coiled coil that scaffolds assembly of dynein-dynactin through its interactions. LIS1 interacts with the dynein motor through a WD40 domain, stabilizing the pre-powerstroke state, and also contacts the dynactin p150 arm to facilitate adaptor binding. This work reveals the essential role of LIS1 in orchestrating assembly of a massive molecular machine. —Michael A. Funk Cryo–electron microscopy reveals the role of the regulator LIS1 in forming active dynein-dynactin complexes. INTRODUCTION Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is a microtubule motor required for fundamental processes such as intracellular trafficking, organelle positioning, and the function of the mitotic spindle. Dynein activation requires the assembly of a ~4-MDa complex with its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific adaptor protein. In cells, a diverse set of these activating adaptors link dynein to its many cargos. They typically contain long coiled coils and specific motifs for binding dynein-dynactin. However, some, such as the lysosomal adaptor JIP3 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 3), contain notably shorter coiled coils and appear to lack some of the required motifs, raising the question of how they work. Additionally, dynein-dynactin complex assembly requires regulatory factors, such as LIS1 (lissencephaly-1) protein, mutations in which are linked to developmental and neurological disorders. LIS1 unlocks dynein’s autoinhibited “phi” state by binding to the motor domain. However, it remains unclear whether this alone mediates its role in complex assembly. RATIONALE In this study, we set out to understand whether JIP3 activates dynein using in vitro motility assays. We then investigated the molecular basis of JIP3-dependent activation by visualizing these complexes, bound to microtubules in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), using cryo–electron microscopy. The inclusion of LIS1 trapped the dynein-dynactin-JIP3 complex in its assembly pathway, providing an explanation for how it and dynactin’s extended p150Glued subunit (p150) stimulate the process. RESULTS We show that JIP3’s short N-terminal coiled coil is sufficient to activate dynein-dynactin. Although not absolutely required for activation, JIP3 contains a Spindly motif. This dynactin-interacting site was previously missed owing to being ~200 amino acids away from the N-terminal coiled coil. We find that JIP3, like many activating adaptors, contains an autoinhibitory mechanism. In JIP3’s case, this mechanism involves a short internal helix that mimics the helices from dynein’s light intermediate chain, which interact with all characterized adaptors. The structure of the dynein-dynactin-JIP3-LIS1 complex contains two dyneins (A and B). Dynein-B is bound to microtubules as seen in a previous structure. In contrast, dynein-A is bound to two LIS1 molecules and detached from the microtubule. The presence of LIS1 leads to docking of dynactin’s p150 arm along the length of the dynein. It also resolves p150’s interaction with a critical helix at the N terminus of dynein’s intermediate chain (DIC-N), known to be needed for dynein activation. Our structure and associated experiments provide insights into the dynein-dynactin-adaptor (DDA) assembly pathway. We find that p150 is in an open conformation. Comparison with a previous folded state suggests that DIC-N binds and opens up the p150 first, allowing subsequent interactions with LIS1 and dynein. We show that LIS1 needs to be able to link p150 and the dynein-A motor to stimulate DDA complex formation. We propose that LIS1 works by tucking dynein under the p150 arm, priming it for efficient adaptor binding. The next step is dynein-B recruitment. We propose that LIS1 is preferentially released from this motor, as it lacks reinforcement from p150. Therefore, dynein-B is the first motor to contact the microtubule, leading to the intermediate state that we have resolved. The likely next step is the release of LIS1 from dynein-A, allowing both motors to drive processive movement. CONCLUSION We show how the protein JIP3 activates dynein, despite its unusual architecture, providing insights into the minimal requirements of dynein-dynactin cargo adaptors. We reveal interactions between dynein, dynactin, and LIS1 that occur during the formation of active dynein complexes. On the basis of our observations, we propose a model where LIS1 cooperates with p150 to orient dynein and dynactin, priming them for productive adaptor binding. Our study uncovers the intricate set of interactions occurring during the formation of active dynein complexes and how LIS1 helps stimulate them. Model for LIS1-mediated dynein-dynactin-adaptor complex assembly. Dynein intermediate chain binds to dynactin’s p150 subunit, relieving dynactin autoinhibition. This allows LIS1 (attached to dynein) to bind p150, which stimulates complex assembly by priming dynein-dynactin for adaptor binding. LIS1 keeps dynein-A detached from microtubules, whereas dynein-B, recruited to the complex, binds to the microtubule. Finally, LIS1 disengages from dynein-A upon movement initiation.",2024,Science,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '7615804', 'DOI': '10.1126/science.adk8544', 'CorpusId': 268733395, 'PubMed': '38547289'}",1,"Given that the study elucidates the molecular mechanisms of dynein-dynactin complex formation and activation, particularly highlighting the roles of the lysosomal adaptor JIP3 and the regulatory protein LIS1, it provides key insights into the intricate interactions that facilitate cellular transport.

Furthermore, LIS1 binds to dynactin's p150 subunit, tethering it along dynein and stabilizing the complex. This suggests a model where LIS1 and p150 orchestrate dynein-dynactin assembly, ensuring efficient adaptor binding and priming the complex for processive movement. This foundational understanding opens up new avenues for exploring how mutations in these regulatory mechanisms could lead to developmental and neurological disorders."
27,6ff7d4cc44b6a582fec11598cc814f2f421f14dd,Sexual dimorphism in skin immunity is mediated by an androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis,"Males and females exhibit profound differences in immune responses and disease susceptibility. However, the factors responsible for sex differences in tissue immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a dominant role for type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in shaping sexual immune dimorphism within the skin. Mechanistically, negative regulation of ILC2s by androgens leads to a reduction in dendritic cell accumulation and activation in males, along with reduced tissue immunity. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis in controlling sexual immune dimorphism. Moreover, this work proposes that tissue immune set points are defined by the dual action of sex hormones and the microbiota, with sex hormones controlling the strength of local immunity and microbiota calibrating its tone. Editor’s summary Differences in immunity are associated with biological sex. Chi et al. found that female mice had higher numbers of T cells, dendritic cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) within the skin (see the Perspective by Puttur and Lloyd). The numbers of these immune cells were regulated by male sex hormones, which are sensed by androgen receptors expressed in ILC2s of both sexes. ILC2s produced cytokines required for skin dendritic cell homeostasis and expressed relatively high levels of the androgen receptor. Negative regulation of ILC2s within the skin in response to androgens could thus restrict the number and activation status of dendritic cells in the skin of male mice, contributing to differences in local immune responses between the sexes. —Sarah H. Ross INTRODUCTION Sexual dimorphisms have been observed in the susceptibility to many cancers, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Differences in the immune system between females and males is thought to contribute to the observed sex-related bias in disease outcomes. Barrier tissues are a primary target of infections and injury. In addition, these sites are continuously colonized by a complex microbial community that also regulates host defense. However, sex-related immune differences in barrier tissues, and how these may be shaped by microbiota, are poorly understood. Expanding the current knowledge about sexual dimorphisms of the immune system may provide insights toward developing sex-refined therapeutic strategies for many diseases. RATIONALE We used mice as a model system with which to compare the innate and adaptive immune cell subsets present in barrier tissues between females and males and to investigate how immunity may underpin sexual dimorphisms in disease outcome. RESULTS Adult female mice had a higher level of skin-resident T cells than did males. These sex-related differences were tissue specific, because we did not observe sex-related differences in the composition of immune cells in the small intestine or in ear-draining lymph nodes. The sex-associated differences in T cell composition in the skin were observed in germ-free mice, which lack microbiota. However, reintroducing a skin microbiome into these mice augmented sex differences in females. We also observed that females had a higher magnitude of skin adaptive immune responses than did males in response to new commensals (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium accolens, or Candida albicans) colonizing the skin or skin infection with S. aureus. Sex differences in the composition of the skin immune system were not observed in mice that had not reached adulthood. In addition, castration of male mice before sexual maturation normalized the skin immune cell numbers and the potency of adaptive immune responses to microbiota to the level seen in females, suggesting a key role for male sex hormones in shaping sex-related differences in skin immunity. In addition to T cells, we observed a higher level of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets (DCs) in females than males, including type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s), Langerhans cells (LCs), and CD11blow type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2s). DCs play a fundamental role in antigen presentation and triggering of adaptive immune responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that skin DCs from females had a more activated gene expression signature than did DCs from males. Functional evaluation of DCs confirmed that DCs from the skin of female mice had enhanced migratory and T cell–priming capabilities compared with those from males. Sex-related differences of skin DCs were dependent on male sex hormones, because castration increased the level of those DCs in males, and testosterone injection decreased skin DC levels in females. The androgen receptor (AR) was not expressed by skin DCs, suggesting that androgens regulate DCs indirectly. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are abundant in the skin and, based on scRNA-seq data, express a higher level of AR than other skin lymphocytes. Female mice had a higher number of skin ILC2s, with a more activating gene expression signature, and produced a higher level of cytokines than ILC2s from males. These differences could be abrogated in male mice by castration or AR knockout. ILC2-deficient transgenic mice (Rag2−/−γc−/− mice) had a disrupted skin DC network, characterized by a decrease of skin cDC1s, LCs, and CD11blow cDC2s. Adoptive transfer of skin ILC2s to Rag2−/−γc−/− mice rescued the level of skin cDC1s. By using a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reporter mouse, we found that most skin ILC2s produced GM-CSF, which is a key cytokine for maintaining the survival of dermal cDC1s. Correspondingly, transferring ILC2s deficient in GM-CSF production (Csf2−/− ILC2s) did not restore the skin cDC1 population, supporting the idea that ILC2s maintain skin cDC1 through the production of GM-CSF. CONCLUSION Skin ILC2s are master players helping to maintain skin DC network homeostasis by producing essential cytokines. Male sex hormones, by negatively regulating skin ILC2s, lead to differences in the DC network, resulting in a heightened adaptive immune response in female mice compared with male mice during commensal colonization and infection. Male sex hormones down-regulate skin immunity in male mice by negatively regulating the ILC2-DC axis. ILC2s produce cytokines that maintain skin DC levels. Androgens, acting through the AR, negatively regulate skin ILC2s, causing sex-related differences in ILC2 and downstream DC populations, which may then affect T cell responses. Therefore, androgen effects on the skin ILC2-DC axis may contribute to the sex bias of adaptive immune responses to bacterial colonization and infection. ILLUSTRATION: N.

The study uncovers the pivotal role of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in mediating sexual immune dimorphism within the skin, predominantly regulated by androgens. Androgens negatively influence ILC2 activity, leading to a decrease in dendritic cell accumulation and activation in males, thereby diminishing tissue immunity. The findings suggest that the androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis is crucial in controlling these sex-specific immune responses. Furthermore, the research proposes that tissue immune set points are defined by the interplay between sex hormones and microbiota, where sex hormones modulate local immune strength, and microbiota calibrates its tone. This insight could potentially guide the development of sex-specific therapeutic strategies for various diseases."

In this work, we report that mice with increased availability of vitamin D display greater immune-dependent resistance to transplantable cancers and augmented responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Similarly, in humans, vitamin D–induced genes correlate with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment as well as with immunity to cancer and increased overall survival. In mice, resistance is attributable to the activity of vitamin D on intestinal epithelial cells, which alters microbiome composition in favor of Bacteroides fragilis, which positively regulates cancer immunity. Our findings indicate a previously unappreciated connection between vitamin D, microbial commensal communities, and immune responses to cancer. Collectively, they highlight vitamin D levels as a potential determinant of cancer immunity and immunotherapy success. Editor’s summary The gut microbiome has been shown to modulate the response of cancer patients to therapy, but precisely how microbiota affect anticancer immunity is still being elucidated. Giampazolias et al. report that vitamin D bioavailability in mice influences the composition of the gut microbiome (see the Perspective by Franco and McCoy). After dietary manipulation, vitamin D levels were observed to affect gut bacteria, which in turn improved cancer immunotherapy and antitumor immunity. In humans, low vitamin D levels were correlated with tumor development, and gene signatures of vitamin D activity were associated with improved patient responses to immunotherapy. These findings highlight the connection between vitamin D and the immune system through gut bacteria and may have applications for improving cancer therapies. —Priscilla N.

Initially, MRI development focused on low fields around 0.05 Tesla, but progress halted after the introduction of the 1.5 Tesla whole-body superconducting scanner in 1983. Using a permanent 0.05 Tesla magnet and deep learning for electromagnetic interference elimination, we developed a whole-body scanner that operates using a standard wall power outlet and without radiofrequency and magnetic shielding. We demonstrated its wide-ranging applicability for imaging various anatomical structures. Furthermore, we developed three-dimensional deep learning reconstruction to boost image quality by harnessing extensive high-field MRI data. These advances pave the way for affordable deep learning–powered ultra-low-field MRI scanners, addressing unmet clinical needs in diverse health care settings worldwide. Editor’s summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was invented more than 50 years ago and has continued to improve in resolution and image quality. These improvements are the result of ever more powerful magnets, which make for very heavy and noisy machines that require extensive shielding. These high-power MRI machines are also extremely expensive, which greatly limits patient access. By applying machine learning to the output of a lower-power MRI device, Zhao et al. were able to address these concerns (see the Perspective by Anazodo and du Plessis). The lower-power machine was much cheaper to manufacture and operate, more comfortable and less noisy for patients, and the final images after computational processing were as clear and detailed as those obtained by the high-power devices currently used in the clinical setting. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich INTRODUCTION Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized healthcare with its nonionizing, noninvasive, multicontrast, and quantitative capabilities. It also presents a promising platform for future artificial intelligence–driven medical diagnoses. However, after five decades of development, MRI accessibility—especially in low and middle-income countries—remains low and highly uneven due to high costs and specialized settings required for standard superconducting MRI scanners. These scanners are mostly found in specialized radiology departments and large imaging centers, restricting their availability in other medical settings. The need for radio frequency (RF)-shielded rooms and high power consumption further adds to hardware cost and compromises mobility and patient-friendliness. RATIONALE We developed a highly simplified whole-body ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI scanner that operates on a standard wall power outlet without RF or magnetic shielding cages. This scanner uses a compact 0.05 Tesla permanent magnet and incorporates active sensing and deep learning to address electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals. We deployed EMI sensing coils positioned around the scanner and implemented a deep learning method to directly predict EMI-free nuclear magnetic resonance signals from acquired data. To enhance image quality and reduce scan time, we also developed a data-driven deep learning image formation method, which integrates image reconstruction and three-dimensional (3D) multiscale super-resolution and leverages the homogeneous human anatomy and image contrasts available in large-scale, high-field, high-resolution MRI data. RESULTS We implemented commonly used clinical protocols at 0.05 Tesla, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging, and optimized their contrasts for different anatomical structures. Each protocol was designed to have a scan time of 8 minutes or less with an image resolution of approximately 2×2×8 mm³. The scanner power consumption during scanning was under 1800W and around 300W when idle. We conducted imaging on healthy volunteers, capturing brain, spine, abdomen, lung, musculoskeletal, and cardiac images. Deep learning signal prediction effectively eliminated EMI signals, enabling clear imaging without shielding. The brain images showed various brain tissues whereas the spine images revealed intervertebral disks, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid. Abdominal images displayed major structures like the liver, kidneys, and spleen. Lung images showed pulmonary vessels and parenchyma. Knee images identified knee structures such as cartilage and meniscus. Cardiac cine images depicted the left ventricle contraction and neck angiography revealed carotid arteries. Furthermore, deep learning image formation greatly improved the 0.05 Tesla image quality for various anatomical structures, including the brain, spine, abdomen, and knee; it also effectively suppressed noise and artifacts and increased image spatial resolution. CONCLUSION To address MRI accessibility challenges, we developed a low-power and simplified whole-body 0.05 Tesla MRI scanner that operates without the need for RF or magnetic shielding and that can be manufactured, maintained, and operated at a low cost. We experimentally demonstrated the general utility of this scanner for imaging various human anatomical structures at a whole-body level, even in the presence of strong EMI signals, with acceptable scan time. Moreover, we demonstrated the potential of deep learning image formation to substantially augment 0.05 Tesla image quality by exploiting computing and extensive high-field MRI data. These advances pave the way for affordable, patient-centric, and deep learning–powered ULF MRI scanners, addressing unmet clinical needs in diverse healthcare settings worldwide.

This analysis of the International Cohort on Lifestyle Determinants of Health (INCLD Health) cohort uses a dietary questionnaire and 16s microbiome data to examine relationships between habitual polyphenol consumption and gut microbiota in healthy adults (n = 96). In this exploratory analysis, microbial taxa, but not diversity measures, differed by levels of dietary polyphenol consumption. Taxa identified as exploratory biomarkers of daily polyphenol consumption (mg/day) included Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Eubacterium ventriosum group, Ruminococcus torques group, and Sutterella. Taxa identified as exploratory biomarkers of the frequency of polyphenol-weighted herb and spice use included Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, Methanobrevibacter, Lachnoclostridium, and Lachnotalea. Several of the differentiating taxa carry out activities important for human health, although out of these taxa, those with previously described pro-inflammatory qualities in certain contexts displayed inverse relationships with polyphenol consumption. Our results suggest that higher quantities of habitual polyphenol consumption may support an intestinal environment where opportunistic and pro-inflammatory bacteria are represented in a lower relative abundance compared to those with less potentially virulent qualities.",2024,Nutrients,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10974568', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16060773', 'CorpusId': 268293783, 'PubMed': '38542685'}",1,"Given that polyphenol consumption is generally linked to beneficial microbial activity and reduced presence of harmful pathogens, there is a need to explore these relationships in the context of habitual dietary intake, particularly through the consumption of culinary herbs and spices.

The findings indicate that specific microbial taxa, rather than overall diversity, are associated with varying levels of polyphenol consumption. Notably, certain beneficial bacteria were found to be more abundant with higher polyphenol intake, while potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria showed an inverse relationship. These results imply that regular polyphenol consumption may create a gut environment that favors beneficial microbes over harmful ones, which could have important implications for dietary recommendations and gut health."
31,33f177a5af253b1bcfa19e615cbc7c054dfd3113,Repeated co-option of HMG-box genes for sex determination in brown algae and animals,"In many eukaryotes, genetic sex determination is not governed by XX/XY or ZW/ZZ systems but by a specialized region on the poorly studied U (female) or V (male) sex chromosomes. Previous studies have hinted at the existence of a dominant male-sex factor on the V chromosome in brown algae, a group of multicellular eukaryotes distantly related to animals and plants. The nature of this factor has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that an HMG-box gene acts as the male-determining factor in brown algae, mirroring the role HMG-box genes play in sex determination in animals. Over a billion-year evolutionary timeline, these lineages have independently co-opted the HMG box for male determination, representing a paradigm for evolution’s ability to recurrently use the same genetic “toolkit” to accomplish similar tasks. Editor’s summary Brown algae are multicellular eukaryotes that evolve independently of animals and plants. Male and female sexes in brown algae are determined by the presence of a V (male) or a U (female) sex chromosome, but the genes determining sex determination remain elusive. Luthringer et al. reported an HMG-box gene, MIN, as being the master regulator of male sex determination in brown algae. A combination of genome mining, gene expression profiling, and functional characterization using deletion lines revealed notable phenotype changes. Deletion of the homologous gene in kelp (another group of brown algae) showed similar phenotypes, indicating conservation of sex determination by MIN. HMG-box genes have been found to represent sex determination factors in animals. These findings in brown algae indicate a striking evolutionary conservation maintained through more than a billion years of evolution. —Ankit Walia Identification of the brown algal master sex factor reveals that animals and seaweeds have converged on male sex determination. INTRODUCTION The evolution of eukaryotic sex and sex-related traits has long fascinated biologists. Although core processes such as meiosis and syngamy are largely conserved, eukaryotes display a considerable diversity of sex-determination systems, raising important questions about the evolutionary dynamics of sex determination. Only a few master sex-determining genes are currently known, preventing a more comprehensive understanding of sex determination in a large phylogenetic context. Are some genes inherently better at regulating sex determination? Is there a common pathway underlying sexual differentiation across eukaryotes? These key questions remain elusive and require an analysis of sex determination that goes beyond animals and plants. RATIONALE In this study, we describe the discovery of the male sex-determining factor in brown algae, a major group of complex multicellular eukaryotes that are distantly related to animals and plants. In brown algae, male and female sexes are determined during the haploid phase of the life cycle by the presence of a V (male) or U (female) sex chromosome. We used classical and reverse genetics, genomics, and cell biology approaches to investigate the role of a candidate V-specific gene in determining male sex in brown algae. RESULTS We demonstrate that a V-specific HMG-box transcription factor, which we have named MIN (for Male INducer), is the male determinant in the model brown alga Ectocarpus and that its role in sex determination is conserved in kelps. HMG-box genes are also involved in sex determination in therian mammals and mating-type determination in fungi. We therefore performed a thorough investigation of the evolutionary history of eukaryotic HMG-box proteins and found that despite more than a billion years of independent evolution, animals and brown algae have independently co-opted the HMG-box for male sex determination. However, brown algae and animals exhibit differences in their sex-determination systems owing to the specific properties of the U and V sex chromosomes. Absence of MIN in males does not lead to sex reversal, demonstrating that the U chromosome is necessary for femaleness; thus female is not the “default” state in brown algae. Accordingly, deletion of MIN in male individuals carrying both the U and V chromosomes does lead to sex reversal, reinforcing the notion that the U chromosome is required for the initiation of the female developmental program. CONCLUSION We provide the first analysis of the molecular basis of sex determination in complex multicellular organisms beyond the animal and plant lineages, adding a new master sex-determining factor to the small list that is currently known. Our study provides evidence that the HMG-box transcription factor MIN, similar to SRY in mammals, is required for male sex determination in brown algae. Our analysis supports an independent co-option hypothesis: HMG-box genes are involved in sex determination in several eukaryotic lineages, but the specific sex-determining genes have evolved independently. Thus, the HMG-box has been recruited multiple times to play a role in sex determination across eukaryotic kingdoms, providing a fascinating example of convergent evolution over a billion-year timescale. A V-specific HMG-box transcription factor, which we have named MIN (for Male INducer), is the master male determinant in brown algae, including Ectocarpus and the kelp Laminaria digitata. In the absence of a functional MIN, asexual “spores” are produced instead of functional sperm. The absence of MIN does not lead to complete sex reversal, demonstrating that the U chromosome is necessary for femaleness. Accordingly, deletion of MIN in individuals carrying both U and V chromosomes does lead to sex reversal. An investigation of the evolutionary history of eukaryotic HMG-box proteins revealed that despite a billion years of independent evolution, animals and phaeophytes (brown algae) have independently co-opted the HMG-box for sex determination.",2024,Science,4,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adk5466', 'CorpusId': 268553470, 'PubMed': '38513029'}",1,"Given that HMG-box genes have been identified as key players in sex determination across various eukaryotic lineages, our research aims to explore the evolutionary conservation and functional roles of these genes in other complex multicellular organisms beyond the well-studied animal and plant kingdoms. The discovery of the HMG-box gene, MIN, as the male-determining factor in brown algae, specifically Ectocarpus and kelps, highlights an intriguing case of convergent evolution, where distinct lineages have independently utilized the HMG-box for male sex determination. This study underscores the potential for similar genetic mechanisms to be at play in other less-studied eukaryotic groups, which could reveal broader principles governing sex determination and evolutionary biology."

We developed a phage-assisted continuous evolution platform for molecular glue complexes (MG-PACE) and evolved a 36–amino acid zinc finger (ZF) degron (SD40) that binds the ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor cereblon in complex with PT-179, an orthogonal thalidomide derivative. Endogenous proteins tagged in-frame with SD40 using prime editing are degraded by otherwise inert PT-179. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of SD40 in complex with ligand-bound cereblon revealed mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of SD40’s activity and specificity. Our efforts establish a system for continuous evolution of molecular glue complexes and provide ZF tags that overcome shortcomings associated with existing degrons. Editor’s summary Degron tags enable rapid and tunable control of target protein levels using small molecules. The ability to develop tags with desirable properties could expand their use in research and biotechnology. Mercer et al. report a continuous evolution platform for generating high-affinity molecular glue complexes. Using this approach, the authors evolved a compact zinc-finger degron that engages the protein cereblon in the presence of thalidomide derivatives that avoid endogenous proteins, unlike the immunomodulatory drugs commonly used to trigger protein degradation. This work provides a compact orthogonal degron tag and a powerful system with which to engineer molecular glue interactions using diverse small molecules. —Di Jiang Rapid evolution of molecular glue interfaces yields a compact small molecule–triggered degron with high target protein specificity. INTRODUCTION Small molecule–triggered protein degradation tags (degrons) are powerful tools to study the effects of the loss of a protein of interest and for target validation. In the presence of a small molecule in mammalian cells, degron tags form a complex with an E3 ubiquitin ligase effector such as cereblon (CRBN). Proteins recruited to this degron•small molecule•E3 ligase ternary complex by fusion to a degron tag are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. RATIONALE Most known degron tags are large protein domains that cannot be easily or cleanly installed in endogenous protein-coding genes. Although zinc finger (ZF) degrons are theoretically small enough for facile endogenous tagging, their degradation is triggered by thalidomide, pomalidomide, and lenalidomide (immunomodulatory drugs, or IMiDs) with substantial off-target degradation effects, precluding their use as specific modulators of target protein levels. Recently, we reported the development of new IMiD derivatives such as PT-179 that bind CRBN but do not induce degradation of off-target proteins. In this study, we developed a phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) platform for generating engineered molecular glue interactions and applied it to evolve ZF degrons that bind CRBN complexed with the otherwise-inactive IMiD derivative PT-179. RESULTS To apply continuous evolution to molecular glue complexes, we developed PACE selections that link phage propagation to molecular glue ternary complex formation (MG-PACE). Over 250 hours of continuous evolution requiring survival through an overall dilution of 10271-fold yielded SD40, a 36–amino acid ZF protein that tightly binds CRBN in complex with PT-179. In mammalian cells, PT-179 potently degrades proteins fused to SD40 at either the N or C terminus. SD40 is small enough for efficient and precise in-frame insertion in target protein-coding genes in human cells using prime editing, enabling minimally perturbative studies of endogenous proteins generated from genes that maintain their native regulatory contexts. To reveal mechanistic insights into the evolution and molecular basis of SD40’s activity and specificity, we determined high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of SD40 in complex with CRBN bound to PT-179 or pomalidomide. SD40 interacts with CRBN’s IMiD-binding C-terminal domain while also forming an extensive interface with its N-terminal domain. We also used MG-PACE to evolve a second ZF degron, SD56, that is functional in mouse cells. Compared with human CRBN, mouse CRBN contains an amino acid substitution that prevents binding of endogenous mouse ZF proteins upon IMiD treatment. MG-PACE evolved SD56 in the presence of mouse CRBN and PT-179. We showed that PT-179 potently degrades SD56-tagged proteins in cultured mouse cells and that SD56 can respond to canonical and next-generation IMiDs, including pomalidomide and mezigdomide. CONCLUSION We developed a continuous evolution system for generating new molecular glue complexes and applied it to remodel the CRBN•IMiD•ZF degron ternary complex. MG-PACE yielded SD40, a compact ZF that mediates potent degradation of tagged proteins in human cells in response to an IMiD-derived small molecule with no detected off-target neosubstrates. SD40 evolved to engage both the N- and C-terminal domains of CRBN, driving CRBN to its putatively active closed conformation. SD40’s small size facilitates efficient installation in endogenous protein-coding genes with prime editing, enabling tunable and selective modulation of endogenous proteins. We also used MG-PACE to develop SD56, a ZF degron that is compatible with PT-179 and other IMiDs in mouse cells. Collectively, our efforts provide a platform for the rapid evolution of tailor-made molecular glue complexes, including compact ZF tags that overcome shortcomings associated with existing degrons. An evolved zinc finger mediates specific degradation of tagged endogenous proteins. (A) We developed a selection system for phage-assisted continuous evolution of molecular glue complexes (MG-PACE). We applied MG-PACE to evolve ZF degrons that engage the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor CRBN only when it is bound to PT-179, a thalidomide derivative that does not exhibit off-target degradation of endogenous human proteins. Assembly of the CRBN•PT-179•ZF ternary complex in host Escherichia coli promotes transcription of the essential phage gene gIII. (B) An ~2.4-Å resolution cryo-EM structure revealed that the evolved ZF protein, SD40 (magenta), engages both CRBN’s IMiD-binding C-terminal domain (CRBNCTD, cyan) and N-terminal domain (CRBNNTD, green) through contacts not previously observed between CRBN and a ZF. (C) SD40 is only 36 amino acids long, enabling clean installation of SD40 in-frame into endogenous genomic protein-coding genes in mammalian cell culture with prime editing.

We developed an animal model with C3 selectively absent in pancreatic β-cells to demonstrate its critical importance in preserving β-cell function and protecting against inflammation-induced β-cell death. This protective mechanism, mediated by cytosolic C3, counters the harmful effects of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β.

However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-awareness, even though they perform in a manner which seems to evince their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision weight over (i) the expected sensory consequences of action and (ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the embodied cognitive system to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through the exploitation of the pragmatic affordances at hand. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested loss of the sense of self-as-object. This involves the inhibition of both the sense of self as a temporally extended object and higher–order, meta-cognitive forms of self-conceptualisation. Nevertheless, we stress that self-awareness is not entirely lost in flow. Rather, it is pre-reflective and bodily. Our approach to bodily-action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of seemingly agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of so-called selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing.",2024,Frontiers in Psychology,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11182004', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1354719', 'CorpusId': 270243030, 'PubMed': '38887627'}",1,"Given that flow is a state of optimal performance characterized by a loss of self-awareness and a sense of effortlessness despite task complexity, this paper investigates these features through the active inference framework.

As bacteria mostly do not possess membrane-bound organelles, they often have to rely on protein-based compartments. Encapsulins are one of the most prevalent protein-based compartmentalization strategies found in prokaryotes. Here, we show that desulfurase encapsulins can sequester and store large amounts of crystalline elemental sulfur. We determine the 1.78-angstrom cryo-EM structure of a 24-nanometer desulfurase-loaded encapsulin. Elemental sulfur crystals can be formed inside the encapsulin shell in a desulfurase-dependent manner with l-cysteine as the sulfur donor. Sulfur accumulation can be influenced by the concentration and type of sulfur source in growth medium.

Ventricular remodeling is fundamentally driven by mechanotransduction that is regulated by both the nervous system and the immune system. However, it remains unknown which key molecular factors govern the neuro/immune/cardio axis that underlies mechanotransduction during ventricular remodeling. Here, we investigated whether the mechanosensitive Piezo cation channel–mediated neurogenic inflammatory cascade underlies ventricular remodeling–related mechanotransduction. METHODS: By ligating the left coronary artery of rats to establish an in vivo model of chronic myocardial infarction (MI), lentivirus-mediated thoracic dorsal root ganglion (TDRG)–specific Piezo1 knockdown rats and adeno-associated virus–PHP.S—mediated TDRG neuron–specific Piezo1 knockout mice were used to investigate whether Piezo1 in the TDRG plays a functional role during ventricular remodeling. Subsequently, neutralizing antibody–mediated TDRG IL-6 (interleukin-6) inhibition rats and adeno-associated virus–PHP.S—mediated TDRG neuron–specific IL-6 knockdown mice were used to determine the mechanism underlying neurogenic inflammation. Primary TDRG neurons were used to evaluate Piezo1 function in vitro. RESULTS: Expression of Piezo1 and IL-6 was increased, and these factors were functionally activated in TDRG neurons at 4 weeks after MI. Both knockdown of TDRG-specific Piezo1 and deletion of TDRG neuron–specific Piezo1 lessened the severity of ventricular remodeling at 4 weeks after MI and decreased the level of IL-6 in the TDRG or heart. Furthermore, inhibition of TDRG IL-6 or knockdown of TDRG neuron–specific IL-6 also ameliorated ventricular remodeling and suppressed the IL-6 cascade in the heart, whereas the Piezo1 level in the TDRG was not affected. In addition, enhanced Piezo1 function, as reflected by abundant calcium influx induced by Yoda1 (a selective agonist of Piezo1), led to increased release of IL-6 from TDRG neurons in mice 4 weeks after MI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a critical role for Piezo1 in ventricular remodeling at 4 weeks after MI and reveal a neurogenic inflammatory cascade as a previously unknown facet of the neuronal immune signaling axis underlying mechanotransduction.",2024,Circulation,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065390', 'CorpusId': 267030890, 'PubMed': '38235590'}",1,"Given that ventricular remodeling is a precursor to heart failure and is driven by mechanotransduction regulated by both the nervous and immune systems, our research aims to investigate the role of the Piezo1 cation channel in this process. Recent findings indicate that increased expression and activation of Piezo1 and IL-6 in thoracic dorsal root ganglion (TDRG) neurons contribute significantly to the severity of ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI). Knockdown or deletion of Piezo1 in TDRG neurons, as well as the inhibition of IL-6, has been shown to ameliorate ventricular remodeling and reduce IL-6 levels in the heart. These results suggest that the Piezo1-mediated neurogenic inflammatory cascade is a critical component of the neuro/immune/cardio axis in mechanotransduction during ventricular remodeling. Our hypothesis is that targeting Piezo1 and the associated inflammatory pathways could provide novel therapeutic strategies for preventing or mitigating heart failure."

To examine CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) BCR (B cell receptor) maturation, we studied LGI1- and CASPR2-antibody encephalitis as model diseases. Systematic reconstruction of CSF BCR repertoires highlighted a dominant representation of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) with marked enrichments for LGI1 or CASPR2 reactivities, universally in larger clonal expansions. Clonally-expanded BCRs had undergone limited intrathecal affinity maturation or mutational activity, alongside low T cell clonality. In contrast, significant LGI1 and CASPR2 affinity was acquired between the germline and intrathecal BCRs.

Fruit Extract Lowers SREBP-1c and C/EBPα in Liver and Alters Various PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, LXR-α Target Genes in Cholesterol-Rich Diet Rabbit Model","Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) fruits, abundant in iridoids and anthocyanins, are natural products with proven beneficial impacts on the functions of the cardiovascular system and the liver. This study aims to assess and compare whether and to what extent two different doses of resin-purified cornelian cherry extract (10 mg/kg b.w. or 50 mg/kg b.w.) applied in a cholesterol-rich diet rabbit model affect the levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), and various liver X receptor-α (LXR-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) target genes. Moreover, the aim is to evaluate the resistive index (RI) of common carotid arteries (CCAs) and aortas, and histopathological changes in CCAs. For this purpose, the levels of SREBP-1c, C/EBPα, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), endothelial lipase (LIPG), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) in liver tissue were measured. Also, the levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (Vaspin), and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) in visceral adipose tissue were measured.

In this work, we show that ODV and its circulating parent nucleoside metabolite, GS-441524, have similar in vitro antiviral activity against filoviruses, including Marburg virus, Ebola virus, and Sudan virus (SUDV). We also report that once-daily oral ODV treatment of cynomolgus monkeys for 10 days beginning 24 hours after SUDV exposure confers 100% protection against lethal infection. Transcriptomics data show that ODV treatment delayed the onset of inflammation and correlated with antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. Our results offer promise for the further development of ODV to control outbreaks of filovirus disease more rapidly. Editor’s summary Filoviruses frequently emerge to cause terrifying outbreaks of often-fatal human disease. Treatment options so far have focused on monoclonal antibodies. Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that binds viral RNA polymerase to block replication by premature termination of RNA transcription. The drug has been successfully used intravenously for treating progressive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in humans. Cross et al. tested a related oral prodrug, obeldesivir (currently in phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment), in nonhuman primates for its therapeutic value against filoviruses (see the Perspective by Sprecher and Van Herp). When administered to the animals within 24 hours of virus exposure once daily for 10 days, the drug conferred complete protection against lethal infection with Sudan ebolavirus. Having an oral drug would be a major logistical advantage for use in the remote, resource-poor areas where filoviruses occur. —Caroline Ash Oral treatment with obeldesivir completely protects macaques from lethal infection with Sudan ebolavirus INTRODUCTION Members of the genus Orthoebolavirus are human pathogens in the family Filoviridae that are responsible for outbreaks of highly fatal hemorrhagic disease, with case fatality rates reaching 90%. Within the genus Orthoebolavirus, three members have caused nearly all known cases of symptomatic disease: Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Bundibugyo virus. The 2013–2016 West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) resulted in almost 29,000 cases and demonstrates the threat that filoviruses pose as important human pathogens. Although licensed vaccines and treatments are available to combat EBOV, there are still no medical countermeasures against any other filovirus that are approved for human use. The 2022–2023 outbreak of disease caused by SUDV in Uganda reminded the public health community of the need for medical interventions against filoviruses other than EBOV. RATIONALE The two licensed monoclonal antibody–based treatments for EVD and most of the promising preclinical postexposure interventions to combat filovirus infection have relied on intravenous delivery of antivirals. Filovirus outbreaks usually occur in resource-poor areas where intravenous therapy can be a substantial logistical challenge. Also, some treatments require intravenous injections over several days, which is difficult even in well-resourced settings. Therefore, there is a need for oral drugs to better control filovirus outbreaks. Obeldesivir (ODV, GS-5245), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor that is an oral alternative to parenterally administered remdesivir, was recently developed and shown to have activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We tested the antiviral activity of ODV against filoviruses in vitro and in a uniformly lethal nonhuman primate (NHP) model of Sudan virus disease (SVD). RESULTS We first assessed the potency of ODV against EBOV, SUDV, and Marburg virus in Huh7 cells and determined that all three filoviruses have similar in vitro antiviral activity (median effective concentration values from 1.89 to 4.16 µM). We then performed two studies to assess the postexposure protective efficacy of ODV in NHPs. In the first study, we show that once-daily oral ODV treatment of NHPs for 10 days beginning 1 day after SUDV exposure confers 100% protection against lethal infection. In the second study, we show that once-daily oral ODV treatment of NHPs for 5 days beginning 1 day after SUDV exposure confers 60% protection against lethal infection. Transcriptomics data showed that ODV treatment delayed the onset of inflammation and correlated with antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. CONCLUSION Our results support the further development of ODV for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of filovirus infections. Although future studies that focus on the therapeutic utility of ODV will complement this work, our data show that ODV has immediate potential for use in the management of filovirus outbreaks. This is important in the context of rapidly treating contacts and contacts of contacts of known SUDV exposures, which can break the chain of transmission and better contain or stop an outbreak. The ease of supply, storage, distribution, and, particularly, administration of oral antivirals compared with parenterally administered agents would facilitate timely initiation of both easily scalable postexposure prophylaxis and early disease treatment. Efficacy of ODV against SUDV. Oral administration of ODV completely protected cynomolgus macaques when given once daily for 10 days after SUDV infection and protected 60% of animals when given for 5 days after infection. Successful ODV treatment delayed or prevented the onset of disease, suppressed viral replication, and prevented immune dysregulation and clotting abnormalities, thereby facilitating lymphocyte activation and the production of anti-SUDV antibodies. mg/kg, mg per kg body weight; PFU im, plaque-forming units administered intramuscularly.

Computational prediction suggests that ARGLU1 contains intrinsically disordered regions and lacks any known structural or functional domains. We used adenovirus Early protein 1A (E1A) to probe for critical regulators of important cellular pathways and identified ARGLU1 as a significant player in transcription and the DNA damage response pathway. Transcriptional effects induced by ARGLU1 occur via enhancement of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing, likely by inhibiting the interaction between JMJD6 and BRD4. When overexpressed, ARGLU1 increases the growth rate of cancer cells, while its knockdown leads to growth arrest. Significantly, overexpression of ARGLU1 increased cancer cell resistance to genotoxic drugs and promoted DNA damage repair. These results identify new roles for ARGLU1 in cancer cell survival and the DNA damage repair pathway, with potential clinical implications for chemotherapy resistance.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11162773', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae208', 'CorpusId': 268666356, 'PubMed': '38520408'}",1,"Given that ARGLU1 is identified as a significant regulator in transcription and the DNA damage response pathway, this research proposes to investigate how ARGLU1 modulates these processes at a molecular level.

However, the potential benefits of caffeine supplementation in cycling disciplines such as cross-country/mountain biking have been rarely studied. In cross-country cycling, performance is dependent on endurance capacity, which may be enhanced by caffeine, but also on the technical ability of the cyclist to overcome the obstacles of the course. So, it is possible that the potential benefits of caffeine are not translated to cross-country cycling. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of acute caffeine intake, in the form of coffee, on endurance performance during a cross-country cycling time trial. Eleven recreational cross-country cyclists (mean ± SD: age: 22 ± 3 years; nine males and two females) participated in a single-blinded, randomised, counterbalanced and crossover experiment. After familiarisation with the cross-country course, participants completed two identical experimental trials after the ingestion of: (a) 3.00 mg/kg of caffeine in the form of soluble coffee or (b) 0.04 mg/kg of caffeine in the form of decaffeinated soluble coffee as a placebo. Drinks were ingested 60 min before performing a 13.90 km cross-country time trial over a course with eight sectors of varying technical difficulty. The time to complete the trial and the mean and the maximum speed were measured through Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Heart rate was obtained through a heart rate monitor. At the end of the time trial, participants indicated their perceived level of fatigue using the traditional Borg scale. In comparison to the placebo, caffeine intake in the form of coffee significantly reduced the time to complete the trial by 4.93 ± 4.39% (43.20 ± 7.35 vs. 41.17 ± 6.18 min; p = 0.011; effect size [ES] = 0.300). Caffeine intake reduced the time to complete four out of eight sectors with different categories of technical difficulty (p ≤ 0.010; ES = 0.386 to 0.701). Mean heart rate was higher with caffeine (169 ± 6 vs. 162 ± 13 bpm; p = 0.046; ES = 0.788) but the rating of perceived exertion at the end of the trial was similar with caffeinated coffee than with the placebo (16 ± 1 vs. 16 ± 2 a.u.; p = 0.676; ES = 0.061).

The study involved eleven recreational cyclists in a controlled, randomized, and crossover design, comparing the effects of caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee. Findings indicated that caffeine significantly improved performance by reducing the time to complete the trial and increasing mean heart rate, without affecting the perceived exertion levels. Thus, caffeine appears to be beneficial not just for endurance capacity but also for enhancing performance in technically demanding cycling disciplines."

Gamma oscillations (30 to 80 hertz), a biomarker of cognitive performance, require and potentiate glutamatergic transmission onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs), suggesting an interface for cell-to-network plasticity. In ex vivo local field potential recordings, we demonstrate long-term potentiation of hippocampal gamma power. Gamma potentiation obeys established rules of PVI plasticity, requiring calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A microcircuit computational model of CA3 gamma oscillations predicts CP-AMPAR plasticity onto PVIs critically outperforms pyramidal cell plasticity in increasing gamma power and completely accounts for gamma potentiation. We reaffirm this ex vivo in three PVI-targeting animal models, demonstrating that gamma potentiation requires PVI-specific signaling via a Gq/PKC pathway comprising mGluR5 and a Gi-sensitive, PKA-dependent pathway. Gamma activity–dependent, metabotropically mediated CP-AMPAR plasticity on PVIs may serve as a guiding principle in understanding network plasticity in health and disease.",2024,Science Advances,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10830109', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adj7427', 'CorpusId': 267361606, 'PubMed': '38295164'}",1,"Given that neuronal network plasticity is crucial for cognitive performance and is linked to gamma oscillations, our research will explore the role of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs) in mediating this plasticity.

We prospectively docked large libraries against unrefined AF2 models of the σ2 and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors, testing hundreds of new molecules and comparing results with those obtained from docking against the experimental structures. Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and AF2 structures, as were affinities. Success in docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences between orthosteric residue conformations in the AF2 models and the experimental structures. Determination of the cryo–electron microscopy structure for one of the more potent 5-HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction. AF2 models may sample conformations that differ from experimental structures but remain low energy and relevant for ligand discovery, extending the domain of structure-based drug design. Editor’s summary Structure-based drug discovery relies on high-resolution experimental structures, and some studies have found that deep-learning structure prediction tools such as AlphaFold2 (AF2) do not perform well for docking of known ligands. Studying two human receptors, Lyu et al. found that using high-confidence AF2-predicted structures as starting models was as effective as using experimental structures for prospective docking campaigns to identify new ligands. The authors followed up on several hundred computational hits and found that there was little to no overlap for the same receptor when starting with the computational model versus the experimental structure. Functional assays revealed that the AF2-docking campaign produced a mixture of agonists and antagonists, whereas only agonists were observed when starting with the agonist-bound structure. These results underscore that there is great potential in some structural predictions for drug discovery. —Michael A. Funk INTRODUCTION Deep-learning methods to predict protein structures, like AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold, have had great impact on structural biology, but their influence on drug discovery is less clear. Recent retrospective docking studies suggest that AF2 models struggle to recapitulate ligand binding modes and to distinguish active from decoy molecules in ligand discovery simulations, compared with the same calculations on experimental structures. Still, these studies are retrospective; how AF2 models perform prospectively for predicting new ligands has not, to our knowledge, been explored. RATIONALE To address this prospective gap, we selected two therapeutic targets for which the AF2 models appeared before the experimental structures were released: the σ2 and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. Whereas the AF2 model resembled experimental structures overall, there were meaningful conformational differences in residues at the ligand binding sites, particularly for the 5-HT2A receptor. To prospectively test the relative ability of the AF2 models to guide the discovery of new ligands, we docked libraries of hundreds of millions to billions of molecules against both the modeled and the experimental structures, prioritizing for synthesis and testing hundreds of high-ranking molecules for each model and structure. We assessed the performance of the AF2 structures versus the experimental structures by hit rate (number experimentally active per number tested) and by hit potency. RESULTS Surprisingly, prospective docking against the AF2 models was as effective as it was for docking against the experimental structures. For the σ2 receptor, 55% of the AF2-derived docking hits were active at 1 µM, whereas docking against the crystal structure led to a 51% hit rate. For the 5-HT2A receptor, 26% of the molecules from the AF2-derived model bound at 10 µM, whereas for the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure, 23% bound. Comparing the affinities of these hits yielded similar conclusions. Against the σ2 receptor, the top 18 hits from the AF2 docking had inhibition constant (Ki) values between 1.6 and 84 nM, similar to the distribution from docking against the receptor crystal structure. Against the 5-HT2A receptor, the AF2 model led, if anything, to more potent and selective compounds compared with docking against the experimental structure. The most potent AF2-derived agonists had median effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 42 nM to 1.6 µM, whereas the cryo-EM–derived docking hits had EC50 values ranging from 246 nM to 3 µM. Three of the AF2-derived docking hits were subtype selective, whereas the cryo-EM–derived docking hits were not. A cryo-EM structure of an AF2-derived agonist bound to the 5-HT2A receptor superposed well with the docking prediction and supported several residue conformations anticipated by the AF2 model that differed from those observed in the original experimental structure. CONCLUSION Differences in the ligand binding sites between AF2 models and experimental structures may reduce the ability of the models to recognize known ligands. For a subset of AF2 models, however, these differences may represent low-energy, alternate receptor conformations that can guide the discovery of new ligands just as well as experimental structures can, potentially expanding the range of proteins that may be targeted for structure-based drug discovery. AF2 structures template prospective ligand discovery. More than 490 million and 1.6 billion molecules were docked against the AF2 and experimental structures for the σ2 and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively. More than 100 high-ranking molecules were prioritized for synthesis and testing for each model and structure (about 500 total molecules). Judging by hit rate and hit affinity, docking against the AF2 models was as effective as docking against the experimental structures. The cryo-EM structure of the agonist Z7757 in complex with the 5-HT2A receptor superposed closely with the computational docking prediction on the AF2 model.

However, as the recruitment of memory B cells (MBCs) to germinal centers (GCs) is inefficient and may be derailed by serum antibody–induced epitope masking, driving further B cell receptor (BCR) modification in GC-experienced B cells after boosting poses a challenge. Using humanized immunoglobulin knockin mice, we found that GT protein trimer immunogen N332-GT5 could prime inferred-germline precursors to the V3-glycan–targeted bnAb BG18 and that B cells primed by N332-GT5 were effectively boosted by either of two novel protein immunogens designed to have minimum cross-reactivity with the off-target V1-binding responses. The delivery of the prime and boost immunogens as messenger RNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) generated long-lasting GCs, somatic hypermutation, and affinity maturation and may be an effective tool in HIV vaccine development. Editor’s summary Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV are generally developed through long co-evolution between the host immune system and the virus. Among the trillions of unique precursor antibodies that can be produced, only a minute fraction have the genetic and structural properties needed to develop into HIV bnAbs. Steichen et al. immunized rhesus macaques with an immunogen designed to induce extremely rare precursor antibodies for one particular HIV bnAb. The vaccine elicited the desired response in all immunized animals. In a preclinical model, Xie et al. used sequential immunization to demonstrate the effective boosting of primed bnAb precursors by two second-stage immunogens (see the Perspective by Sanders and Moore). The prime-boost regimen could be more effective when delivered by mRNA lipid nanoparticles. These data suggest that mRNA vaccines may be an important tool in developing the sequence of HIV immunizations. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) isolated from HIV-1–infected patients demonstrate that the humoral immune system can develop effective antibody responses to HIV, even if those antibodies are rare and the result of a somewhat winding journey. Germline-targeting (GT) vaccination seeks to induce bnAbs through sequential immunization. To overcome the relatively low affinity of many germline precursors to bnAbs to the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env), precursors to bnAbs are identified and first-round immunogens developed to prime those responses; later-stage boost immunogens with an increasing number of native-Env features are then meant to continue guiding the evolution of B cell receptors (BCRs) to bnAb development. However, previous work has found that high-affinity, epitope-focused responses to primes may inhibit later boost stages, thus potentially undercutting the GT approach. RATIONALE The development of a vaccine to induce bnAbs similar to the V3-glycan–targeting bnAb BG18 has been a key goal of much GT vaccine work. Previously, our group developed a mouse cell line with B cell receptors bearing the heavy chain of a human BG18 precursor. B cells from this cell line were adoptively transferred into wild-type (WT) mice to produce a stringent preclinical model, which was used to validate a series of GT priming immunogens. In this study, that BG18 precursor model was used to investigate a next-generation priming immunogen (N332-GT5), followed by one of two new boost immunogens (B11 and B16) designed to limit off-target responses to the V1 loop. As mRNA–lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunogens were found to be highly effective during the COVID-19 pandemic, protein trimer and mRNA-LNP regimens were compared. RESULTS We found that both new boost immunogens (B11 and B16) could drive further maturation of BG18 precursors in a stringent humanized mouse model when delivered after an N332-GT5 protein trimer prime. An mRNA-LNP delivery of both the prime and boost phases also provided long-term activation and was observed to drive somatic hypermutation. Both the protein trimer and mRNA-LNP regimens facilitated boost-stage responses, which may be the result of either germinal center (GC) refueling or of memory B cell re-recruitment to germinal centers. CONCLUSION Our prime-boost regimen has demonstrated on-target activation and boosting of V3-glycan–class responses in a high-bar preclinical model, revealing that boosting can occur after a GT prime. The effectiveness of both protein and mRNA prime-boost regimens opens the route to the clinical development of a sequential HIV vaccine centered on the V3-glycan epitope.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and antimicrobial polymers (APs) are known for their antimicrobial properties and can be considered an alternative approach to fighting resistant microorganisms. Hence, the main goal of this research is to shed some light on the antimicrobial properties of Ag-NPs and APs (chitosan (CH), poly-L-lysine (PLL), ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PLL), and dopamine (DA)) when used alone and complexed to explore the potential enhancement of the antimicrobial effect of the combination Ag-NPs + Aps. The resultant nanocomplexes were chemically and morphologically characterized by UV-visible spectra, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, the Ag-NPs, APs, and Ag-NPs + APs nanocomplexes were tested against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, as well as the fungi Candida albicans (C. albicans). Overall, the antimicrobial results showed potentiation of the activity of the nanocomplexes with a focus on C. albicans. For the biofilm eradication ability, Ag-NPs and Ag-NPs + DA were able to significantly remove S. aureus preformed biofilm, and Ag-NPs + CH were able to significantly destroy C. albicans biofilm, with both performing better than Ag-NPs alone.

Some NLRs are encoded in tightly linked co-regulated head-to-head genes whose products function together as pairs. We uncover the oligomerization requirements for different Arabidopsis paired CHS3-CSA1 alleles. These pairs form resting-state heterodimers that oligomerize into complexes distinct from NLRs analyzed previously. Oligomerization requires both conserved and allele-specific features of the respective CHS3 and CSA1 Toll-like interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The receptor kinases BAK1 and BIRs inhibit CHS3-CSA1 pair oligomerization to maintain the CHS3-CSA1 heterodimer in an inactive state. Our study reveals that paired NLRs hetero-oligomerize and likely form a distinctive “dimer of heterodimers” and that structural heterogeneity is expected even among alleles of closely related paired NLRs. Editor’s summary Plant immune responses are frequently detected by intracellular receptors known as nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). Some NLRs work in pairs to transduce signals and initiate cell death response to prevent pathogen spread. Yang et al. found that some NLR pairs heterodimerize and are kept in this inactive state by receptor-like kinases such as BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1). On activation, the heterodimers can oligomerize, which is required to initiate downstream responses. The authors provide mechanistic insight into how paired NLRs activate plant immunity. —Madeleine Seale Pairs of intracellular immune receptors heterodimerize and oligomerize to activate immunity in plants. INTRODUCTION Plants rely on an innate immune system to defend themselves against pathogen invasion. Nucleotide-binding (NB)leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) are important components of intracellular innate immunity across all kingdoms. Plant NLRs are classified into two major groups, CNLs and TNLs, based on the presence of different N-terminal domains: Most NLRs express either a coiled-coil (CC) domain (CNLs) or a Toll-like interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (TNLs). Some NLRs function as singletons, with one NLR protein mediating both pathogen recognition and subsequent downstream immune activation. However, some NLRs are encoded in a head-to-head orientation on the chromosome and function together—these are called paired NLRs. One member of each paired NLR is a so-called sensor that recognizes pathogen proteins or their activities and then activates an associated executor NLR to initiate immune signaling. Ligand-induced formation of various types of NLR oligomers, called resistosomes, mediates NLR function. However, oligomerization status and resistosome formation of paired NLRs are not currently understood. RATIONALE NLRs are the most variable gene families in plants. Our recent studies demonstrated that allelic Arabidopsis TNL CHS3-CSA1 pairs can be divided into three phylogenetic clades. CHS3 is the sensor, and CSA1 is the executor. The CHS3-CSA1 TNL alleles evolved two different types of pairs and two separable regulatory modes for their activation across these three clades. We deployed two functionally distinct CHS3-CSA1 allelic pairs in a model to study the diverse oligomerization requirements and specific mechanism of activation of this paired TNL family. RESULTS We found that the sensor CHS3 and executor CSA1 from clade 2 or clade 3 form the same size oligomers only in combination with their genetically encoded partners. Self-association of either CHS3 or CSA1 is weak in the absence of its partner, but heterocomplexes of CHS3 and CSA1 are readily detected when they are coexpressed. CHS3 and CSA1 from clade 2 or clade 3 oligomerize and form hetero-oligomers but not separate homo-oligomers. Mutations in the AE interface and the BB-loop of both CHS3 and CSA1 TIR domains suggested that the AE interface in the TIR domain of both CHS3 and CSA1 mediates essential head-to-head interaction for heterodimer formation and that the BB-loop in the TIR domains mediates essential head-to-tail interaction and dimerization of the heterodimers, eventually forming a heterotetramer. Mutational analysis of CHS3-CSA1 pairs from both clades also defined clade-specific TIR domain requirements for function and oligomerization, suggesting that TNL CHS3-CSA1 pairs from different clades form a distinct hetero-oligomeric complex. Coexpression of the previously defined negative regulators BAK1 or BIRs with the CHS3-CSA1 pair inhibited oligomerization but not heterodimer formation. These results suggest that paired NLRs exist at rest as heterodimers but form distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes to function and that the inactive state of paired NLRs can be maintained through the suppression of oligomerization by the negative regulators. CONCLUSION A stepwise mechanism of paired TNL CHS3-CSA1 alleles immune activation is proposed on the basis of our findings and on the basis of previous biochemical studies. In the resting state, the majority of CHS3 and CSA1 from clades 2 or 3 form heterodimers and cannot further oligomerization because of the negative regulation by BAK1 and BIR proteins. Upon modulation of the BAK1 and/or BIRs by pathogens, host damage–associated patterns, or other mechanisms, suppression is relieved and the heterodimers of the CHS3-CSA1 pair further dimerize and likely form a distinct “dimer of heterodimers” oligomer. The interaction of CHS3 and CSA1 TIR domains leads to opening of the two CSA1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrolase (NADase) active sites to initiate immune response and cell death. Our work uncovers the diverse oligomerization requirements of different CHS3-CSA1 alleles and suggests that structural heterogeneity can be expected even among alleles of closely related paired NLRs.

In c-NHEJ during V(D)J recombination, DNA-PK promotes the processing of the ends and the opening of the DNA hairpins by recruiting and/or activating the nuclease Artemis/DCLRE1C/SNM1C. Paradoxically, DNA-PK is also required to prevent the fusions of newly replicated leading-end telomeres. Here, we describe the role for DNA-PK in controlling Apollo/DCLRE1B/SNM1B, the nuclease that resects leading-end telomeres. We show that the telomeric function of Apollo requires DNA-PKcs’s kinase activity and the binding of Apollo to DNA-PK. Furthermore, AlphaFold-Multimer predicts that Apollo’s nuclease domain has extensive additional interactions with DNA-PKcs, and comparison to the cryo-EM structure of Artemis bound to DNA-PK phosphorylated on the ABCDE/Thr2609 cluster suggests that DNA-PK can similarly grant Apollo access to the DNA end. In agreement, the telomeric function of DNA-PK requires the ABCDE/Thr2609 cluster. These data reveal that resection of leading-end telomeres is regulated by DNA-PK through its binding to Apollo and its (auto)phosphorylation-dependent positioning of Apollo at the DNA end, analogous but not identical to DNA-PK dependent regulation of Artemis at hairpins.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11077071', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae105', 'CorpusId': 267927938, 'PubMed': '38407308'}",1,"Summary: Given that DNA-PK plays a crucial role in both the synapsis and joining of double strand breaks during canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) and the prevention of fusions of newly replicated leading-end telomeres, our research proposes to investigate the regulatory mechanisms by which DNA-PK controls these distinct processes. Specifically, our findings indicate that DNA-PK's kinase activity and its interaction with the nuclease Apollo are essential for the resection of leading-end telomeres. Additionally, structural predictions and comparisons suggest that DNA-PK facilitates Apollo's access to DNA ends in a manner that mirrors, yet differs from, its regulation of the nuclease Artemis during V(D)J recombination.

To determine whether PRDM9 directs recombination in nonmammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species with a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog, the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus). Analyzing historical recombination rates along the genome and crossovers in pedigrees, we found evidence that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events, but we also detected a separable effect of promoter-like features. These findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive and instead reflect a tug-of-war that is more even in some species than others. Editor’s summary Where meiotic recombination occurs in the genome varies across species. In humans and some other mammals, binding sites of the protein PRDM9 determine recombination hotspot locations, whereas in other species without PRDM9, these tend to occur in CpG islands and near promoters. Hoge et al. identified historic patterns of linkage disequilibrium and crossover events from pedigrees in the corn snake, which has a single intact ortholog of PRDM9. They found that crossover events occurred at both PRDM9-determined hotspots as well as promoter-like regions. This suggests that multiple processes, rather than the presence of PRDM9 alone, underlie the recombination landscape in a species. —Corinne Simonti Evidence from the corn snake suggests that PR domain zinc finger protein 9 may not act alone to specify recombination hotspots in all species. INTRODUCTION A confluence of evidence from mouse genetics, statistical genetics, and evolutionary biology has revealed that in vertebrates, at least two distinct mechanisms direct meiotic recombination events to the genome. In many mammalian species, including humans and mice, recombination occurs almost exclusively at the binding sites of the protein PRDM9. In such species, the binding affinity of PRDM9 is rapidly evolving, driving rapid turnover in the recombination landscape. In contrast, in taxa without an intact PRDM9, such as birds and canids, recombination events tend to occur near promoter-like features such as transcription start sites and CpG islands, and recombination rates are much more stable over time. RATIONALE The rapid evolution of complete orthologs of PRDM9 in nonmammalian vertebrates suggests that the protein may play a similar role in directing recombination outside of mammals. To test this prediction, we focused on the example of corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus), which carry a single, complete ortholog of PRDM9. After improving the corn snake reference genome and annotation, we generated a population recombination map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium along the genome and identified a set of crossovers from resequenced pedigrees. RESULTS Corn snakes harbor a great diversity of PRDM9 alleles. Their predicted binding sites are associated with increased population recombination rates and crossovers in pedigrees, indicating that PRDM9 specifies the location of some recombination events in corn snakes. In contrast to what has been observed in mammals that rely on PRDM9, however, recombination rates also increase near promoter-like features, and the effects appear to be independent from those of PRDM9. Together with other lines of evidence, notably signals of biased-gene conversion, our findings establish that recombination at PRDM9 binding sites and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive mechanisms. Moreover, the relative importance of PRDM9 binding sites and promoter-like features appears to differ between macrochromosomes and microchomosomes. We propose that changes to ZCWPW2, a reader of the epigenetic marks made by PRDM9, and likely other genes, underlie this dual usage of PRDM9 binding sites and promoter-like regions. CONCLUSION These findings reveal that the fine-scale recombination landscape of species with PRDM9 reflects a tug-of-war between competing signals, the outcome of which is lopsided in mammals studied to date but much more even in snakes. These results provide a new understanding of how recombination hotspots arise in mammals and across vertebrates. They also illustrate how the study of nonmodel organisms can inform our understanding of basic genetic mechanisms. Meiotic recombination localization across vertebrates. Evidence from historical recombination rates, DNA substitution patterns, and crossovers in pedigrees shows that corn snake meiotic recombination events are concentrated at both PRDM9 binding sites and promoter-like features, with fewer events at promoter-like features on microchromosomes than macrochromosomes. These observations indicate that the uses of promoter-like features and PRDM9 binding to direct recombination rates to the genome are not mutually exclusive.",2024,Science,3,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adj7026', 'CorpusId': 267806136, 'PubMed': '38386752'}",1,"Given that PRDM9 plays a crucial role in directing meiotic recombination in mammals, whereas promoter-like features drive recombination in vertebrates lacking PRDM9, I propose to examine whether these mechanisms might coexist in nonmammalian vertebrates.

This has resulted in it gaining increasing attention as a potential antibiotic alternative; however, its practical use has been limited by its weak antimicrobial activity, high hemolytic activity, and low proteolytic stability. In this study, N-terminal fatty acid conjugation was used to develop new melittin-derived lipopeptides (MDLs) to improve the characteristics of melittin. Our results showed that compared with native melittin, the antimicrobial activity of MDLs was increased by 2 to 16 times, and the stability of these MDLs against trypsin and pepsin degradation was increased by 50 to 80%. However, the hemolytic activity of the MDLs decreased when the length of the carbon chain of fatty acids exceeded 10. Among the MDLs, the newly designed analog Mel-C8 showed optimal antimicrobial activity and protease stability. The antimicrobial mechanism studied revealed that the MDLs showed a rapid bactericidal effect by interacting with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and penetrating the bacterial cell membrane.

The E3 ligase DA2 has been reported to activate the peptidase DA1 by ubiquitination, hereby limiting cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate DA2 remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that DA2 has a very high turnover and auto-ubiquitinates with K48-linkage polyubiquitin chains, which is counteracted by two deubiquitinating enzymes, UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 12 (UBP12) and UBP13. Unexpectedly, we found that auto-ubiquitination of DA2 does not influence its stability but determines its E3 ligase activity. We also demonstrate that impairing the protease activity of DA1 abolishes the growth-reducing effect of DA2. Last, we show that synthetic, constitutively activated DA1-ubiquitin fusion proteins overrule this complex balance of ubiquitination and deubiquitination and strongly restrict growth and promote endoreduplication.

This study aimed to design and develop advanced drug delivery systems composed of poloxamer 407, a non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80), and cyclodextrins (methyl-β-CD or hydroxy-propyl-β-CD) for possible brain targeting of ropinirole after nasal administration for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The hybrid systems were formed by the thin-film hydration method, followed by an extensive physicochemical and morphological characterization. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the systems on HEK293 cell lines was also tested. In vitro release and ex vivo mucosal permeation of ropinirole were assessed using Franz cells at 34 °C and with phosphate buffer solution at pH 5.6 in the donor compartment, simulating the conditions of the nasal cavity. The results indicated that the diffusion-controlled drug release exhibited a progressive increase throughout the experiment, while a proof-of-concept experiment on ex vivo permeation through rabbit nasal mucosa revealed a better performance of the prepared hybrid systems in comparison to ropinirole solution. The encouraging results in drug release and mucosal permeation indicate that these hybrid systems can serve as attractive platforms for effective and targeted nose-to-brain delivery of ropinirole with a possible application in Parkinson’s disease.

In plants and animals, large supramolecular complexes often activate immune proteins for protection. In this work, we resolved the native structure of a massive host-defense complex that polymerizes 30,000 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) over the surface of gram-negative bacteria inside human cells. Construction of this giant nanomachine took several minutes and remained stable for hours, required guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and recruited four GBPs plus caspase-4 and Gasdermin D as a cytokine and cell death immune signaling platform. Cryo–electron tomography suggests that GBP1 can adopt an extended conformation for bacterial membrane insertion to establish this platform, triggering lipopolysaccharide release that activated coassembled caspase-4. Our “open conformer” model provides a dynamic view into how the human GBP1 defense complex mobilizes innate immunity to infection. Editor’s summary Human cells have many mechanisms to detect and respond to bacterial and viral intruders. Proteins that recognize bacterial cell wall components can coat the surface of invading bacteria and serve as a scaffold for the assembly of signaling proteins and antimicrobial enzymes. Zhu et al. performed genetic, biochemical, and structural experiments to reveal how this large protein complex is formed and to understand how it functions to protect cells from intracellular infection. Cryo–electron tomography revealed that monomers and dimers of GBP1 form an even coating on bacteria, and medium-resolution reconstructions suggested that an extended conformation allows the protein to insert into and disrupt the bacterial outer membrane. —Michael A. Funk and Stella M. Hurtley Thousands of guanylate-binding proteins directly coat cytosolic bacteria to create an antimicrobial signaling platform. INTRODUCTION The compartmentalized landscape of eukaryotic cells offers a wide variety of intracellular niches for microbial pathogens to hide and replicate. Consequently, eukaryotes have evolved compartment-specific immune surveillance mechanisms that alert the host to infection and recruit antimicrobial proteins that help bring microbial replication under control. Many of these host defense proteins form giant macromolecular complexes when encountering either pathogens or their products to amplify innate immune signaling and spatially localize protein partners at the site of microbial recognition. In some cases, complete signaling cascades are built directly upon the invading pathogen itself, a distinctive situation in which a large foreign object acts as the anchoring platform for assembling the entire host defense machinery. How these massive host-pathogen platforms are initiated and structurally organized at the molecular level remains unknown. RATIONALE Since their discovery in the physical assembly of antimicrobial and innate immune signaling complexes over a decade ago, guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) have emerged as major organizers of intracellular host defense to a broad array of bacteria, viruses, or parasites in animals and plants. In mammals, these large dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) relocate to intracellular pathogens, where they can establish macromolecular assemblies on the microbial outer membrane (OM) that serve as interactive hubs for inflammatory proteins or bactericidal effectors as part of the cell-autonomous innate immune response. To better understand the mechanistic details underlying these distinct hybrid structures, we enlisted host and bacterial genetics plus single-particle nanoscopy and cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize GBP defense complexes on the surface of a gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Stm), within the cytosol of human cells. RESULTS We identified a multiprotein defense complex assembled directly on Stm inside human cells. This defense complex comprised four members of the human GBP family (GBP1, GBP2, GBP3, and GBP4) together with human caspase-4 and one of its natural substrates, full-length Gasdermin D (GSDMD). It triggered innate immune signaling through caspase-4 cleavage of GSDMD into its pore-forming subunits, resulting in the extracellular release of an immune cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18), and pyroptotic cell death needed for protection against this bacterial pathogen. Notably, human GBP1 was obligate for initiating the entire signaling cascade; its genetic removal prevented the remaining immune proteins being recruited onto the gram-negative bacterial surface. C-terminal anchorage and GTPase-driven self-assembly enabled GBP1 to bind to and polymerize over the surface of cytosolic Stm to establish the recruitment platform. Nearly 30,000 GBP1 molecules were assembled in just a few minutes. Reconstitution of this massive GBP1 defense complex with a bacterial minicell system allowed cryo-ET visualization of the entire coat structure in its native state. Within this native platform, individual GBP1 dimers were found to adopt an open conformation for vertical insertion into the bacterial OM through their extended C-terminal lipidated tail. Anchorage of the upright GBP1 conformer led to OM disruption, which released the gram-negative cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to activate coassembled caspase-4. CONCLUSION An emerging paradigm for innate immune signaling cascades is the higher-order assembly of repetitive protein units that generate large polymers capable of amplifying signal transduction. Our results identify human GBP1 as the principal repetitive unit, numbering thousands of proteins per bacillus, that undergoes dramatic conformational opening to establish a host defense platform directly on the surface of gram-negative bacteria. This platform enabled the recruitment of other immune partners, including GBP family members and components of the inflammasome pathway, that initiate protective responses downstream of activating cytokines such as interferon-γ. Elucidating this giant molecular structure not only expands our understanding of how human cells recognize and combat infection but may also have implication for antibacterial approaches within the human population.

K. pneumoniae in this biofilm state demonstrates remarkable resistance, evades immune system attacks, and poses challenges for complete eradication, thereby complicating clinical anti-infection efforts. Moreover, the precise mechanisms governing biofilm formation and disruption remain elusive. Recent studies have discovered that fingolimod (FLD) exhibits biofilm properties against Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the antibiofilm properties of FLD were evaluated against multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae in this study. The antibiofilm activity of FLD against K. pneumoniae was assessed utilizing the Alamar Blue assay along with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and crystal violet (CV) staining. The results showed that FLD effectively reduced biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS), motility, and bacterial abundance within K. pneumoniae biofilms without impeding its growth and metabolic activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory impact of FLD on the production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signaling molecules was identified, thereby demonstrating its notable anti-quorum sensing (QS) properties. The results of qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that FLD significantly decreased the expression of genes associated with the efflux pump gene (AcrB, kexD, ketM, kdeA, and kpnE), outer membrane (OM) porin proteins (OmpK35, OmpK36), the quorum-sensing (QS) system (luxS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production (wzm), and EPS production (pgaA).

We found that the EBV protein EBNA2 initiates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo biosynthesis by driving expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells. Virus-enforced NAD production sustained mitochondrial complex I activity, to match adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production with bioenergetic requirements of proliferation and transformation. In transplant patients, IDO1 expression in EBV-infected B cells, and a serum signature of increased IDO1 activity, preceded development of lymphoma. In humanized mice infected with EBV, IDO1 inhibition reduced both viremia and lymphomagenesis. Virus-orchestrated NAD biosynthesis is therefore a druggable metabolic vulnerability of EBV-driven B cell transformation, opening therapeutic possibilities for EBV-related diseases. Editor’s summary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a prevalent, persistent infection in humans. Although many cases are asymptomatic, EBV may cause disease in individuals with a weakened immune system. Müller-Durovic et al. found that the virally encoded protein EBNA2 induced the expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells and sustained their subsequent proliferation and transformation into malignant cells. In transplant recipients, elevated expression of IDO1 in B cells preceded the development of lymphoma. Treating mice with a small-molecule inhibitor of IDO1 before infection with EBV decreased the development of tumors, suggesting that blocking the pathway might be a strategy for protecting EBV-negative individuals receiving solid organ transplants. —Sarah H. Ross INTRODUCTION More than 90% of the adult population worldwide are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV, which belongs to the γ-herpes virus family, is transferred through saliva, and, if symptomatic, de novo infection causes infectious mononucleosis. The virus is B cell tropic and establishes lifelong latent infection in this cellular compartment. Originally, EBV was identified in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells, and the virus is well known for its growth-transforming and tumorigenic properties. EBV can also cause life-threatening hyperinflammation (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) and has also been strongly associated with the development of autoimmunity (e.g., multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus). When infecting B cells, EBV causes their rapid growth and proliferation, a metabolically demanding process that is a prerequisite for establishing latency. RATIONALE The metabolic challenge that EBV imposes on nascently infected B cells may create bottlenecks for the virus en route to establishing latent infection. Targeting such early host cell metabolic dependencies of EBV could hinder progression to latency, the infection stage underpinning most EBV-related pathologies. RESULTS We performed unbiased metabolomic and transcriptome-based analyses and found evidence that the activity of the kynurenine pathway and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo synthesis pathway were up-regulated in B cells during the prelatency phase after EBV infection. We discovered that the viral protein, EBV-encoded transactivator EBNA2, in cooperation with the host B cell transcription factor EBF1, drove induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway. IDO1-dependent degradation of tryptophan fueled NAD de novo synthesis, which supported mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production in the early phase of EBV infection. Pharmacologic inhibition of IDO1 rendered B cells up to 100-fold less susceptible to EBV transformation, a hurdle that was removed by adding back the product of IDO1, kynurenine, as well as by supplementing nicotinic acid mononucleotide, the direct precursor of NAD. In the peripheral blood of patients that eventually developed posttransplant lymphoma, we identified a population of B cells that expressed EBNA2 as well as IDO1, suggesting that, before development of EBV-driven malignancy, the molecular axis we uncovered in vitro may be engaged in vivo. In mice, blocking IDO1 pharmacologically, or deleting IDO1 genetically in B cells, reduced EBV viral loads and inhibited the formation of B cell tumors. CONCLUSION Early after infecting B cells, EBV induced the expression of IDO1 in host cells, which changed the activity of B cell metabolic pathways. Hijacking this host axis was a metabolic requirement for the virus to efficiently establish latent infection, in vitro and in vivo. Targeting IDO1 clinically may thus offer an opportunity to interfere with progression of EBV infection in B cells from prelatency to latency. EBV-naïve solid organ transplant recipients are at a very high risk for developing posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), particularly when EBV-negative recipients receive tissue from EBV-positive donors. In this context, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 could limit EBV-driven pathology. Precisely defining metabolic bottlenecks that viruses have evolved to depend upon in vivo may identify druggable targets beyond IDO1 in other settings. Latent EBV infection depends on IDO1. More than 90% of the adult population are infected with EBV. (A) Unbiased analyses identified up-regulation of kynurenine pathway (KP) activity early after EBV infection of B cells.

The research indicates that by driving NAD biosynthesis, IDO1 activity supports the bioenergetic demands of infected B cells, facilitating their transformation and the establishment of latency. Pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 not only reduces EBV transformation in vitro but also decreases viremia and tumor formation in vivo, particularly in the context of transplant recipients who are at high risk for EBV-related lymphomas. Therefore, my research hypothesis is that targeting IDO1 or similar metabolic dependencies in EBV-infected cells can provide a strategic intervention to prevent or treat EBV-associated diseases, including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs)."

In these proteins, the BTB domain, which represents the defining element of the family, may have the dual role of promoting oligomerization and favoring functionally important partnerships with different interactors. Here, by exploiting the potential of recently developed methodologies for protein structure prediction, we report a comprehensive analysis of the interactions of all KCTD proteins with their most common partner Cullin 3 (Cul3). The data here presented demonstrate the impressive ability of this approach to discriminate between KCTDs that interact with Cul3 and those that do not. Indeed, reliable and stable models of the complexes were only obtained for the 15 members of the family that are known to interact with Cul3. The generation of three-dimensional models for all KCTD–Cul3 complexes provides interesting clues on the determinants of the structural basis of this partnership as clear structural differences emerged between KCTDs that bind or do not bind Cul3.

The extent of their potential for fine-tuning gene expression is still being discovered. Several studies have implicated certain circular RNAs in pathophysiological processes within vascular endothelial cells and cancer cells independently. However, to date, no comparative study of circular RNA expression in different types of endothelial cells has been performed and analysed through the lens of their central role in vascular physiology and pathology. In this work, we analysed publicly available and original RNA sequencing datasets from arterial, veinous, and lymphatic endothelial cells to identify common and distinct circRNA expression profiles. We identified 4713 distinct circRNAs in the compared endothelial cell types, 95% of which originated from exons. Interestingly, the results show that the expression profile of circular RNAs is much more specific to each cell type than linear RNAs, and therefore appears to be more suitable for distinguishing between them. As a result, we have discovered a specific circRNA signature for each given endothelial cell type. Furthermore, we identified a specific endothelial cell circRNA signature that is composed four circRNAs: circCARD6, circPLXNA2, circCASC15 and circEPHB4. These circular RNAs are produced by genes that are related to endothelial cell migration pathways and cancer progression.

To achieve this, first-year medical students at Wroclaw Medical University were invited to participate in the study during both the initial and final months of their first academic year. The study included 570 students in the initial period and 705 in the latter. The research questionnaire comprised the KomPAN, assessing nutritional knowledge, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), evaluating sleep quality. The majority of students demonstrated at least sufficient nutritional knowledge, while approximately two-thirds of students experienced poor sleep in both periods. Notably, sleep quality further deteriorated in the second period (PSQI total score: 6.86 vs. 7.38, p = 0.0157). This change was influenced mainly by a decrease in sleep duration and an increase in the use of sleep medications (both p < 0.0001). The significant difference in overall sleep quality between different nutritional knowledge levels emerged only in the second semester, where students with the highest nutritional knowledge slept the best, while those with the lowest slept the worst (p = 0.0001). Crucially, in both periods, the use of sleep medications was highest among individuals with insufficient nutritional knowledge. Throughout the academic year, the usage increased for all except those with the highest nutritional knowledge, who exhibited the best sleep (p < 0.0001). The escalating use of sleep medications among medical students warrants greater attention, and leveraging the relationship between nutritional knowledge and sleep could prove beneficial, as positive habits in one domain may positively influence the other.",2024,Nutrients,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10819250', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020278', 'CorpusId': 267091840, 'PubMed': '38257170'}",1,"Given that the first year of medical school significantly impacts both nutritional knowledge and sleep quality among students, my research hypothesis aims to explore whether targeted nutritional education interventions can improve sleep quality and reduce the reliance on sleep medications among medical students. The study highlights that while a majority of students possess at least sufficient nutritional knowledge, poor sleep quality is prevalent and worsens over the academic year. Notably, students with higher nutritional knowledge demonstrate better sleep quality and a lower dependency on sleep medications, suggesting a potential beneficial relationship between nutritional education and sleep health. By investigating this relationship further, we could develop strategies to enhance both nutritional habits and sleep quality, ultimately supporting overall well-being and academic performance in medical students."

When ER stress is generated, an autophagic self-digestive process is activated to promote cell survival; however, cell death is induced in the case of excessive levels of ER stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a natural compound called sulforaphane (SFN) upon ER stress. Our goal was to investigate how SFN-dependent autophagy activation affects different stages of ER stress induction. We approached our scientific analysis from a systems biological perspective using both theoretical and molecular biological techniques. We found that SFN induced the various cell-death mechanisms in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The short SFN treatment at low concentrations promoted autophagy, whereas the longer treatment at higher concentrations activated cell death. We proved that SFN activated autophagy in a mTORC1-dependent manner and that the presence of ULK1 was required for its function. A low concentration of SFN pre- or co-treatment combined with short and long ER stress was able to promote cell survival via autophagy induction in each treatment, suggesting the potential medical importance of SFN in ER stress-related diseases.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11154497', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021220', 'CorpusId': 267194569, 'PubMed': '38279216'}",1,"Given that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can lead to either cell survival or cell death depending on its severity, this study explores the role of sulforaphane (SFN) in mediating autophagy and cell fate during different stages of ER stress. The research reveals that SFN can induce autophagy and promote cell survival at low concentrations and short exposure times, while higher concentrations and prolonged exposure trigger cell death. The findings suggest that SFN activates autophagy through an mTORC1-dependent pathway and requires ULK1 for its function. Furthermore, low concentration SFN treatments, whether administered before or during ER stress, enhance cell survival by inducing autophagy, underscoring the potential therapeutic significance of SFN in managing ER stress-related diseases."

In this study, we investigated the effect of Bacillus licheniformis ZW3 (ZW3), a potential probiotic isolated from camel feces, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The results showed ZW3 partially mitigated body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon shortening, and suppressed immune response in colitis mice, as evidenced by the reduction in the levels of the inflammatory markers IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 (p < 0.05). ZW3 was found to ameliorate DSS-induced dysfunction of the colonic barrier by enhancing mucin 2 (MUC2), zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), and occludin. Furthermore, enriched beneficial bacteria Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and decreased harmful bacteria Escherichia-Shigella revealed that ZW3 improved the imbalanced gut microbiota.

There are a multitude of repeat motifs found in the human population at this locus, some of which are pathogenic and others benign. In this study, we conducted structure-functional analyses of the pathogenic (A2G3)n and nonpathogenic (A4G)n repeats. We found that the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat presents a potent, orientation-dependent impediment to DNA polymerization in vitro. The pattern of the polymerization blockage is consistent with triplex or quadruplex formation in the presence of magnesium or potassium ions, respectively. Chemical probing of both repeats in vitro reveals triplex H-DNA formation by only the pathogenic repeat. Consistently, bioinformatic analysis of S1-END-seq data from human cell lines shows preferential H-DNA formation genome-wide by (A2G3)n motifs over (A4G)n motifs. Finally, the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat stalls replication fork progression in yeast and human cells. We hypothesize that the CANVAS-causing (A2G3)n repeat represents a challenge to genome stability by folding into alternative DNA structures that stall DNA replication.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11077069', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae124', 'CorpusId': 267781576, 'PubMed': '38381906'}",1,"Given that the CANVAS-causing (A2G3)n repeat in the RFC1 gene presents a significant obstacle to DNA polymerization and replication fork progression, this study suggests that the pathogenic nature of these repeats may be due to their propensity to form alternative DNA structures, such as triplex or quadruplex formations, which are not observed in benign (A4G)n repeats. The differential formation of these structures in the presence of magnesium or potassium ions, as well as the observed replication stalling in yeast and human cells, supports the hypothesis that these alternative DNA structures are a critical factor in the genome instability associated with CANVAS. This research underscores the importance of understanding how specific repeat expansions can lead to pathogenic outcomes through their biophysical properties and interactions with cellular replication machinery."

Knocking out CCR5 in HIV patients, which has occurred <10 times, is believed important for cure. JAK/STAT inhibitors tofacitinib and ruxolitinib inhibit CCR5 expression in HIV+ viremic patients. We investigated the association of JAK/STAT signaling pathway with CCR5/CCR2 expression in human primary CD4+ T cells and confirmed its importance. Six of nine JAK/STAT inhibitors that reduced CCR5/CCR2 expression were identified. Inhibitor-treated CD4+ T cells were relatively resistant, specifically to R5-tropic HIV infection. Furthermore, single JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B knockout and different combinations of JAK/STAT knockout significantly reduced CCR2/CCR5 expression of both RNA and protein levels, indicating that CCR5/CCR2 expression was positively regulated by JAK-STAT pathway in CD4+ T cells. Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) knockout affected CCR2/CCR5 gene expression, suggesting that SGK1 is involved in CCR2/CCR5 regulation.

The Mediterranean diet (MD), renowned for its potential health benefits, and the influence of adherence thereto on gut microbiota have become a focus of research. Our aim was to elucidate the impact of adherence to the MD on gut microbiota composition in a well-defined cohort. In this prospective study, healthy volunteers completed a questionnaire to provide demographic data, medical history, and dietary intake. Adherence was evaluated using the Med-DQI. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Analysis of sequencing data and statistical analysis were performed using MOTHUR software and R. The study included 60 patients (51.7% females). Adherence correlated with alpha diversity, and higher values were recorded in good adherers. Good adherers had a higher abundance of Paraprevotella and Bacteroides (p < 0.001). Alpha diversity correlated inversely with fat intake and positively with non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs). Evenness correlated inversely with red meat intake and positively with NSPs. Predicted functional analysis highlighted metabolic pathway differences based on adherence to the MD.

While the memory-enhancing impacts of S. scardica are well documented, the cognitive benefits of C. vulgare remain unexplored. This study assessed the potential effect of C. vulgare on learning and memory in healthy and scopolamine (Sco)-induced memory-impaired male Wistar rats, comparing it with the effects of S. scardica. Over a 21-day period, rats orally received extracts of cultivated S. scardica (200 mg/kg) and C. vulgare (100 mg/kg), either individually or in combination, with administration starting 10 days before and continuing 11 days simultaneously with Sco injection at a dose of 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The results showed that both extracts effectively mitigated Sco-induced memory impairment. Their combination significantly improved recognition memory and maintained monoaminergic function. S. scardica excelled in preserving spatial working memory, while C. vulgare exhibited comparable retention of recognition memory, robust antioxidant activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.

No reliable diagnostic, predictive techniques, or curative interventions are available. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are vital to controlling gene expression, making them valuable biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. This study examines the transcriptome of olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from individuals with the PSEN1(A431E) mutation (Jalisco mutation). The aim is to determine whether this mutation affects the transcriptome and expression profile of miRNAs and their target genes at different stages of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic conditions. Expression microarrays compare the MSCs from mutation carriers with those from healthy donors. The results indicate a distinct variation in the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs among different symptomatologic groups and between individuals with the mutation. Using bioinformatics tools allows us to identify target genes for miRNAs, which in turn affect various biological processes and pathways. These include the cell cycle, senescence, transcription, and pathways involved in regulating the pluripotency of stem cells. These processes are closely linked to inter- and intracellular communication, vital for cellular functioning.

Dopamine is involved in reward, motivation, and social behavior. Thus, we evaluated whether neonatal ethanol exposure (in an animal model of FASDs) has an impact on social recognition memory using the three-chamber social novelty discrimination test during early and middle adolescence in male and female rats, and whether the modafinil analog, the novel atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor CE-123, can modify this effect. Our study shows that male and female rats neonatally exposed to ethanol exhibited sex- and age-dependent deficits in social novelty discrimination in early (male) and middle (female) adolescence. These deficits were specific to the social domain and not simply due to more general deficits in learning and memory because these animals did not exhibit changes in short-term recognition memory in the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, early-adolescent male rats that were neonatally exposed to ethanol did not show changes in the anxiety index but demonstrated an increase in locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with CE-123, however, prevented the appearance of these social deficits. In the hippocampus of adolescent rats, CE-123 increased BDNF and decreased its signal transduction TrkB receptor expression level in ethanol-exposed animals during development, suggesting an increase in neuroplasticity.

In addition, Tat stimulates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways to regulate viral gene expression although its molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that Tat directly activates NF-κB through the interaction with TRAF6, which is an essential upstream signaling molecule of the canonical NF-κB pathway. This interaction increases TRAF6 oligomerization and auto-ubiquitination, as well as the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to further activate the NF-κB pathway and HIV-1 transcription. Moreover, ectopic expression of TRAF6 significantly activates HIV-1 transcription, whereas TRAF6 knockdown inhibits transcription. Furthermore, Tat-mediated activation of NF-κB through TRAF6 is conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV isolates.

This research extensively investigates the structure of and variations in Cephalopholis species mitogenomes, along with their phylogenetic relationships, focusing specifically on Cephalopholis taeniops from the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The generated mitogenome spans 16,572 base pairs and exhibits a gene order analogous to that of the ancestral teleost’s, featuring 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and an AT-rich control region. The mitogenome of C. taeniops displays an AT bias (54.99%), aligning with related species. The majority of PCGs in the mitogenome initiate with the start codon ATG, with the exceptions being COI (GTG) and atp6 (TTG). The relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed the maximum abundance of leucine, proline, serine, and threonine. The nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios were <1, which indicates a strong negative selection among all PCGs of the Cephalopholis species. In C. taeniops, the prevalent transfer RNAs display conventional cloverleaf secondary structures, except for tRNA-serine (GCT), which lacks a dihydrouracil (DHU) stem. A comparative examination of conserved domains and sequence blocks across various Cephalopholis species indicates noteworthy variations in length and nucleotide diversity. Maximum likelihood, neighbor-joining, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, employing the concatenated PCGs and a combination of PCGs + rRNAs, distinctly separate all Cephalopholis species, including C. taeniops.

The purpose of this investigation was to explore the influences of Clostridium tyrobutyricum (Ct) on lipid metabolism, intestinal barrier function, and intestinal microbiome in obese mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). After establishing the obesity model, 107 CFU/mL and 108 CFU/mL C. tyrobutyricum were used to intervene in HFD-fed mice by gavage for six weeks, and indexes related to obesity were measured. In the liver of HFD-fed mice, the results revealed that C. tyrobutyricum reduced liver weight and the levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), along with decreasing red lipid droplets and fat vacuoles. After C. tyrobutyricum intervention, the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) was downregulated, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were upregulated in the liver. Additionally, C. tyrobutyricum alleviated intestinal morphology injury caused by HFD, decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-1β in the colon, and upregulated tight junction protein expression. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that C. tyrobutyricum increases the diversity of intestinal microbiota.

Although current treatments initially reduce the lung cancer burden, relapse occurs in most cases; the major causes of mortality are drug resistance and cancer stemness. Recent investigations have provided evidence that shikonin generates various bioactivities related to the treatment of cancer. We used shikonin to treat multi-resistant non-small lung cancer cells (DOC-resistant A549/D16, VCR-resistant A549/V16 cells) and defined the anti-cancer efficacy of shikonin. Our results showed shikonin induces apoptosis in these ABCB1-dependent and independent chemoresistance cancer sublines. Furthermore, we found that low doses of shikonin inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer stem-like cells by inhibiting spheroid formation. Concomitantly, the mRNA level and protein of stemness genes (Nanog and Oct4) were repressed significantly on both sublines. Shikonin reduces the phosphorylated Akt and p70s6k levels, indicating that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is downregulated by shikonin. We further applied several signaling pathway inhibitors that have been used in anti-cancer clinical trials to test whether shikonin is suitable as a sensitizer for various signaling pathway inhibitors. In these experiments, we found that low doses shikonin and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor (BEZ235) have a synergistic effect that inhibits the spheroid formation from chemoresistant lung cancer sublines. Inhibiting the proliferation of lung cancer stem cells is believed to reduce the recurrence of lung cancer; therefore, shikonin’s anti-drug resistance and anti-cancer stem cell activities make it a highly interesting molecule for future combined lung cancer therapy.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10779050', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25010616', 'CorpusId': 266781432, 'PubMed': '38203787'}",1,"Given that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality primarily due to drug resistance and cancer stemness, recent research has highlighted the potential of shikonin as an effective treatment. This study demonstrates that shikonin not only induces apoptosis in multi-drug-resistant non-small lung cancer cells but also effectively inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer stem-like cells by disrupting spheroid formation and downregulating key stemness genes and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, shikonin exhibited a synergistic effect with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235, suggesting its potential use as a sensitizer in combination therapies. These findings propose that shikonin could be a promising candidate for overcoming drug resistance and reducing cancer recurrence in lung cancer therapy."

Recently, islet cell heterogeneity, exemplified by β-cell dedifferentiation and identified in diabetic animals, has attracted attention as an underlying molecular mechanism of β-cell dysfunction. Previously, we reported β-cell dedifferentiation suppression by calorie restriction, not by reducing hyperglycemia using hypoglycemic agents (including sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors), in an obese diabetic mice model (db/db). Here, to explore further mechanisms of the effects of food intake on β-cell function, db/db mice were fed either a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet (db-HC) or a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet (db-HF) using similar calorie restriction regimens. After one month of intervention, body weight reduced, and glucose intolerance improved to a similar extent in the db-HC and db-HF groups. However, β-cell dedifferentiation did not improve in the db-HC group, and β-cell mass compensatory increase occurred in this group. More prominent fat accumulation occurred in the db-HC group livers. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, mainly regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, differed significantly between groups. In conclusion, the fat/carbohydrate ratio in food during calorie restriction in obese mice affected both liver lipid metabolism and β-cell dedifferentiation.",2024,Nutrients,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11013071', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16070995', 'CorpusId': 268833504, 'PubMed': '38613031'}",1,"Given that β-cell dysfunction is a critical factor in diabetes progression, this study investigates the impact of diet composition during calorie restriction on β-cell dedifferentiation and liver lipid metabolism in an obese diabetic mouse model. The research compares the effects of a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet versus a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet under similar calorie restriction conditions. The findings suggest that while both diets result in comparable improvements in body weight and glucose intolerance, only the low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet mitigates β-cell dedifferentiation and avoids excessive liver fat accumulation. This highlights the significance of dietary macronutrient composition, beyond calorie reduction alone, in managing β-cell function and metabolic health in diabetes."

The amino-terminal domain of TBC1D23 binds to the golgins, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of TBC1D23 captures the vesicles, but how it recognizes specific vesicles was unclear. A search for binding partners of the carboxyl-terminal domain unexpectedly revealed direct binding to carboxypeptidase D and syntaxin-16, known cargo proteins of the captured vesicles. Binding is via a threonine-leucine-tyrosine (TLY) sequence present in both proteins next to an acidic cluster. A crystal structure reveals how this acidic TLY motif binds to TBC1D23. An acidic TLY motif is also present in the tails of other endosome-to-Golgi cargo, and these also bind TBC1D23. Structure-guided mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domain that disrupt motif binding in vitro also block vesicle capture in vivo. Thus, TBC1D23 attached to golgin-97 and golgin-245 captures vesicles by a previously undescribed mechanism: the recognition of a motif shared by cargo proteins carried by the vesicle.",2024,Science Advances,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11093223', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adl0608', 'CorpusId': 268750333, 'PubMed': '38552021'}",1,"Given that TBC1D23, a protein involved in vesicle trafficking, captures transport vesicles arriving from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus by binding to golgin-97 and golgin-245, our research will explore the hypothesis that TBC1D23 recognizes these vesicles through a specific interaction with an acidic threonine-leucine-tyrosine (TLY) motif present in the cargo proteins. Recent findings have identified direct binding of TBC1D23 to carboxypeptidase D and syntaxin-16, facilitated by this TLY motif, and structural analysis has elucidated the binding mechanism.

Here, we generated a high affinity soluble T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) peptide presented by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule HLA-E. Therapeutic targeting HLA-E peptide complexes overcomes HLA-restriction and is therefore applicable to a broad patient population due to HLA-E limited polymorphism. We show that TCR-bispecific molecules, comprised of an affinity-enhanced TCR fused to an anti-CD3-activating domain, specifically induce T cell–mediated killing of Mtb-infected cells.

Regulations by R-met are involved in key biological processes deeply studied in metazoan. Among those, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) can be regulated by R-met in animals and in plants. It mainly contributes to safeguard processes as protection of genome integrity in germlines through the regulation of piRNA pathway in metazoan, or response to bacterial infection through the control of AGO2 in plants. So far, only PRMT5 has been identified as the AGO/PIWI R-met writer in higher eukaryotes. We uncovered that AGO1, the main PTGS effector regulating plant development, contains unique R-met features among the AGO/PIWI superfamily, and outstanding in eukaryotes. Indeed, AGO1 contains both symmetric (sDMA) and asymmetric (aDMA) R-dimethylations and is dually targeted by PRMT5 and by another type I PRMT in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed also that loss of sDMA didn’t compromise AtAGO1 subcellular trafficking in planta. Interestingly, we underscored that AtPRMT5 specifically promotes the loading of phasiRNA in AtAGO1.

Here, we show that depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z in mouse skeletal muscle causes oxidative stress, oxidation of proteins, accumulation of DNA damages, and both neuromuscular junction and mitochondria lesions that consequently lead to premature muscle aging and reduced life span. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved shows that H2A.Z is required to initiate DNA double strand break repair by recruiting Ku80 at DNA lesions. This is achieved via specific interactions of Ku80 vWA domain with H2A.Z.

The present study aimed to unveil the kidney microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in a model of obesity-induced kidney disease in C57BL/6J mice using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity led to notable structural alterations in tubular and glomerular regions of the kidney, increased renal expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic genes, as well as an elevated renal expression of genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism. The miRNA sequencing analysis identified a set of nine miRNAs differentially expressed in the kidney upon HFD feeding, with miR-5099, miR-551b-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-146a-3p and miR-21a-3p showing the most significant differential expression between standard diet (STD) and HFD mice. A validation analysis showed that the expression levels of miR-5099, miR-551b-3p and miR-146a-3p were consistent with NGS results, while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed that these three validated miRNAs modulated target genes involved in metabolic and adipocytokine pathways, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and inflammatory, senescence and profibrotic pathways.

Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is a C4 model crop renowned for its exceptional nutritional value and stress tolerance characteristics. However, there is a lack of research on the identification of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms governing this process. In this study, a dark-induced senescence (DIS) experimental system was applied to investigate the extensive physiological and transcriptomic changes in two foxtail millet varieties with different degrees of leaf senescence. The physiological and biochemical indices revealed that the light senescence (LS) variety exhibited a delayed senescence phenotype, whereas the severe senescence (SS) variety exhibited an accelerated senescence phenotype. The most evident differences in gene expression profiles between these two varieties during DIS included photosynthesis, chlorophyll, and lipid metabolism. Comparative transcriptome analysis further revealed a significant up-regulation of genes related to polysaccharide and calcium ion binding, nitrogen utilization, defense response, and malate metabolism in LS. In contrast, the expression of genes associated with redox homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and hormone signaling was significantly altered in SS. Through WGCNA and RT-qPCR analyses, we identified three SAGs that exhibit potential negative regulation towards dark-induced leaf senescence in foxtail millet.

The TaCKX gene family members (GFMs) have already been shown to regulate yield-related traits, including grain mass and number, leaf senescence, and root growth. The genes encode cytokinin (CK) degrading enzymes (CKXs) and are specifically expressed in different parts of developing wheat plants. The aim of the study was to identify and characterize TaNACs involved in the cis-regulation of TaCKX GFMs. After analysis of the initial transcription factor data in 1.5 Kb cis-regulatory sequences of a total of 35 homologues of TaCKX GFMs, we selected five of them, namely TaCKX1-3A, TaCKX22.1-3B, TaCKX5-3D, TaCKX9-1B, and TaCKX10, and identified five TaNAC genes: TaNACJ-1, TaNAC13a, TaNAC94, TaNACBr-1, and TaNAC6D, which are potentially involved in the cis-regulation of selected TaCKX genes, respectively. Protein feature analysis revealed that all of the selected TaNACs have a conserved NAC domain and showed a stable tertiary structure model. The expression profile of the selected TaNACs was studied in 5 day-old seedling roots, 5–6 cm inflorescences, 0, 4, 7, and 14 days-after-pollination (DAP) spikes, and the accompanying flag leaves.

We recently characterized a Leishmania complex containing a J-binding protein, PP1 protein phosphatase 1, and PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) that controls transcription termination potentially via dephosphorylation of Pol II by PP1. While T. brucei contains eight PP1 isoforms, none purified with the PNUTS complex, complicating the analysis of PP1 function in termination. We now demonstrate that the PP1-binding motif of TbPNUTS is required for function in termination in vivo and that TbPP1-1 modulates Pol II termination in T. brucei and dephosphorylation of the large subunit of Pol II. PP1-1 knock-down results in increased cellular levels of phosphorylated RPB1 accompanied by readthrough transcription and aberrant transcription of the chromosome by Pol II, including Pol I transcribed loci that are typically silent, such as telomeric VSG expression sites involved in antigenic variation.

In T. brucei, despite the presence of eight PP1 isoforms, only one, TbPP1-1, has been shown to influence Pol II termination and dephosphorylation of its large subunit. The necessity of the PP1-binding motif in TbPNUTS for proper termination in vivo, along with TbPP1-1 knock-down leading to increased phosphorylation of RPB1 and aberrant transcription activity, underscores the critical role of PP1-1 in maintaining transcriptional integrity and allelic exclusion of VSG genes. This insight advances our understanding of the transcription termination mechanism in these primitive eukaryotes, which could inform future therapeutic strategies targeting transcriptional regulation in these parasites."

This study examined the effect of competition level and playing position on dietary intake in male soccer players (SP). Diet was weighed and recorded by 123 SP for 3 days; before, on the day, and the day after an official match. SP in the Super League (SL, n = 33) division reported higher (p < 0.05) average three-day energy (195 ± 36 kJ/kg), carbohydrate (6.0 ± 1.1 g/kg), and protein (2.2 ± 0.5 g/kg) intakes compared to the intakes reported by SP in the 2nd (n = 30) (energy: 159 ± 31 kJ/kg; carbohydrate: 4.6 ± 1.2 g/kg; protein: 1.9 ± 0.4 g/kg), 3rd (n = 30) (energy: 153 ± 34 kJ/kg; carbohydrate: 4.5 ± 1.2 g/kg; protein: 1.7 ± 0.4 g/kg), and 4th (n = 30) (energy: 152 ± 36 kJ/kg; carbohydrate: 4.2 ± 1.2 g/kg; protein: 1.7 ± 0.5 g/kg) national leagues (mean ± SD).

To overcome this, we have engineered a tRNA chimera bearing T-stem of tRNAGlu and D-arm of tRNAPro1, referred to as tRNAPro1E2, which efficiently recruits EF-Tu and EF-P. Using tRNAPro1E2 indeed improved β-amino acid incorporation. However, multiple/consecutive incorporations of β-amino acids are still detrimentally poor. Here, we attempted fine-tuning of the anticodon arm of tRNAPro1E2 aiming at further enhancement of β-amino acid incorporation. By screening various mutations introduced into tRNAPro1E2, C31G39/C28G42 mutation showed an approximately 3-fold enhancement of two consecutive incorporation of β-homophenylglycine (βPhg) at CCG codons. The use of this tRNA made it possible for the first time to elongate up to ten consecutive βPhg's. Since the enhancement effect of anticodon arm mutations differs depending on the codon used for β-amino acid incorporation, we optimized anticodon arm sequences for five codons (CCG, CAU, CAG, ACU and UGG). Combination of the five optimal tRNAs for these codons made it possible to introduce five different kinds of β-amino acids and analogs simultaneously into model peptides, including a macrocyclic scaffold. This strategy would enable ribosomal synthesis of libraries of macrocyclic peptides containing multiple β-amino acids.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11194099', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae219', 'CorpusId': 268887820, 'PubMed': '38572748'}",1,"Given that ribosomal incorporation of β-amino acids into peptides is inherently inefficient compared to α-amino acids, this research proposes engineering a tRNA chimera to enhance this process.

Mining the quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and gene loci controlling ECQ-related traits is vital. A genome-wide association study on ECQ-related traits was conducted, combining 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the phenotypic data of 173 rice accessions. Two QTLs for GT, one for GC and five for AC were identified, of which two were found in previously reported genes, and six were newly found. There were 28 positional candidate genes in the region of qAC11. Based on a linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, three candidate genes were screened within the LD region associated with AC. There were significant differences between the haplotypes of LOC_Os11g10170, but no significant differences were found for the other two genes. The qRT-PCR results showed that the gene expression levels in the accessions with high ACs were significantly larger than those in the accessions with low ACs at 35d and 42d after flowering. Hap 2 and Hap 3 of LOC_Os11g10170 reduced the AC by 13.09% and 10.77%, respectively.

Firstly, these bacteria can accumulate multiple genes, each conferring resistance to a specific drug, within a single cell. This accumulation usually takes place on resistance plasmids (R). Secondly, multidrug resistance can arise from the heightened expression of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps, which expel a broad spectrum of drugs from the bacterial cells. Additionally, bacteria can also eliminate or destroy antibiotic molecules by modifying enzymes or cell walls and removing porins. A significant limitation of traditional multidrug therapy lies in its inability to guarantee the simultaneous delivery of various drug molecules to a specific bacterial cell, thereby fostering incremental drug resistance in either of these paths. Consequently, this approach prolongs the treatment duration. Rather than using a biologically unimportant coformer in forming cocrystals, another drug molecule can be selected either for protecting another drug molecule or, can be selected for its complementary activities to kill a bacteria cell synergistically. The development of a multidrug cocrystal not only improves tabletability and plasticity but also enables the simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs to a specific bacterial cell, philosophically perfecting multidrug therapy. By adhering to the fundamental tenets of multidrug therapy, the synergistic effects of these drug molecules can effectively eradicate bacteria, even before they have the chance to develop resistance. This approach has the potential to shorten treatment periods, reduce costs, and mitigate drug resistance. Herein, four hypotheses are presented to create complementary drug cocrystals capable of simultaneously reaching bacterial cells, effectively destroying them before multidrug resistance can develop. The ongoing surge in the development of novel drugs provides another opportunity in the fight against bacteria that are constantly gaining resistance to existing treatments. This endeavour holds the potential to combat a wide array of multidrug-resistant bacteria.",2024,Frontiers in Immunology,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10897028', 'DOI': '10.3389/fimmu.2024.1352483', 'CorpusId': 267662157, 'PubMed': '38415251'}",1,"Given that multidrug-resistant bacteria develop resistance through mechanisms such as the accumulation of resistance genes and the expression of efflux pumps, and that traditional multidrug therapies fail to ensure the simultaneous delivery of various drugs to specific bacterial cells, leading to prolonged treatment durations and incremental resistance, I propose the development of multidrug cocrystals. These cocrystals, which incorporate multiple drugs with complementary activities into a single formulation, can enhance tabletability and plasticity, ensuring the simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs to bacterial cells.

Subsequent analysis of DSC thermograms, augmented using mathematical equations such as the Gordon–Taylor and Couchman–Karasz equations, facilitated the determination of predicted values for glass transition (Tg), PTR’s miscibility with PVP, and the strength of PTR’s interaction with the polymers. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis validated interactions maintaining PTR’s amorphous state and identified involved functional groups, namely, the 4′–OH and/or –CH groups of PTR and the C=O group of PVP. The study culminated in evaluating the impact of amorphization on water solubility, the release profile in pH 6.8, and in vitro permeability (PAMPA-GIT and BBB methods). In addition, it was determined how improving water solubility affects the increase in antioxidant (ABTS, DPPH, CUPRAC, and FRAP assays) and neuroprotective (inhibition of cholinesterases: AChE and BChE) properties.

Previous studies have examined DP96R along with other genes in an effort to create live attenuated vaccines. While experiments in pigs have explored the impact of DP96R on the pathogenicity of ASFV, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we describe a novel molecular mechanism by which DP96R suppresses interferon regulator factor-3 (IRF3)-mediated antiviral immune responses. DP96R interacts with a crucial karyopherin (KPNA) binding site within IRF3, disrupting the KPNA-IRF3 interaction and consequently impeding the translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus. Under this mechanistic basis, the ectopic expression of DP96R enhances the replication of DNA and RNA viruses by inhibiting the production of IFNs, whereas DP96R knock-down resulted in higher IFNs and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription during ASFV infection. Collectively, these findings underscore the pivotal role of DP96R in inhibiting IFN responses and increase our understanding of the relationship between DP96R and the virulence of ASFV.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10889005', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042099', 'CorpusId': 267603633, 'PubMed': '38396775'}",1,"Given that the African swine fever virus (ASFV) protein DP96R, also known as uridine kinase (UK), plays a significant role in virulence by suppressing interferon regulator factor-3 (IRF3)-mediated antiviral immune responses, my research aims to further elucidate the molecular interactions between DP96R and host immune pathways. The novel mechanism identified shows that DP96R disrupts the interaction between IRF3 and a key karyopherin (KPNA) binding site, preventing IRF3's nuclear translocation and subsequent interferon production. This inhibition facilitates enhanced viral replication, highlighting the potential of targeting DP96R for developing more effective antiviral strategies and live attenuated vaccines for ASFV."

The genetics and metabolism of H. uvarum have been poorly studied as compared to other yeasts of biotechnological importance. This work describes the construction and characterization of homozygous deletion mutants in the HuZWF1 gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), which provides the entrance into the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serves as a major source of NADPH for anabolic reactions and oxidative stress response. Huzwf1 deletion mutants grow more slowly on glucose medium than wild-type and are hypersensitive both to hydrogen peroxide and potassium bisulfite, indicating that G6PDH activity is required to cope with these stresses. The mutant also requires methionine for growth. Enzyme activity can be restored by the expression of heterologous G6PDH genes from other yeasts and humans under the control of a strong endogenous promoter. These findings provide the basis for a better adaptation of H. uvarum to conditions used in wine fermentations, as well as its use for other biotechnological purposes and as an expression organism for studying G6PDH functions in patients with hemolytic anemia.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10889316', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042395', 'CorpusId': 267763155, 'PubMed': '38397078'}",1,"Given that Hanseniaspora uvarum is a predominant yeast in wine fermentation and has recently become amenable to genetic manipulation, this study explores the genetic and metabolic roles of the HuZWF1 gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).

These findings pave the way for optimizing H. uvarum for wine fermentation processes and potential biotechnological applications, including studies related to hemolytic anemia."

Previous studies showed that the P1 region (residues 36–42) of α-synuclein controls amyloid formation. We here report a single nucleotide polymorphism in the P1 region of γ-synuclein (γSyn) (Met38 to Ile) found in two individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Both individuals have a second polymorphism in the same gene (Glu110 to Val) that is commonly found in the general population. We show that Ile38-containing γSyn forms amyloid rapidly in vitro, while Met38 does not aggregate into amyloid and Val110 is protective, slowing aggregation.

In this study, we investigated whether mEHT accelerates the tumor-specific delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) from lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) and improves its anticancer efficacy in mice bearing a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (4T1). The 4T1 cells were orthotopically injected into Balb/C mice, and mEHT was performed on days 9, 12, and 15 after the implantation. DOX, LTLD, or PEGylated liposomal DOX (PLD) were administered for comparison. The tumor size and DOX accumulation in the tumor were measured. The cleaved caspase-3 (cC3) and cell proliferation were evaluated by cC3 or Ki67 immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The LTLD+mEHT combination was more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than the free DOX and PLD, demonstrated by reductions in both the tumor volume and tumor weight. LTLD+mEHT resulted in the highest DOX accumulation in the tumor one hour after treatment. Tumor cell damage was associated with cC3 in the damaged area, and with a reduction in Ki67 in the living area. These changes were significantly the strongest in the LTLD+mEHT-treated tumors. The body weight loss was similar in all mice treated with any DOX formulation, suggesting no difference in toxicity.

Exogenous nitrogen can affect the secondary growth of poplar, and some regulatory mechanisms have been found in the secondary xylem. However, the effect of nitrogen on cambium has not been reported. Herein, we investigated the effects of different nitrogen concentrations on cambium development using combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis. The results show that, compared with 1 mM NH4NO3 (M), the layers of hybrid poplar cambium cells decreased under the 0.15 mM NH4NO3 (L) and 0.3 mM NH4NO3 (LM) treatments. However, there was no difference in the layers of hybrid poplar cambium cells under the 3 mM NH4NO3 (HM) and 5 mM NH4NO3 (H) treatments. Totals of 2365, 824, 649 and 398 DEGs were identified in the M versus (vs.) L, M vs. LM, M vs. HM and M vs. H groups, respectively. Expression profile analysis of the DEGs showed that exogenous nitrogen affected the gene expression involved in plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway and the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. In M vs. L, M vs. LM, M vs. HM and M vs. H, differential metabolites were enriched in flavonoids, lignans, coumarins and saccharides. The combined analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome showed that some genes and metabolites in plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways may be involved in nitrogen regulation in cambium development, whose functions need to be verified. In this study, from the point of view that nitrogen influences cambium development to regulate wood formation, the network analysis of the transcriptome and metabolomics of cambium under different nitrogen supply levels was studied for the first time, revealing the potential regulatory and metabolic mechanisms involved in this process and providing new insights into the effects of nitrogen on wood development.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816006', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021017', 'CorpusId': 267088680, 'PubMed': '38256092'}",1,"Given that secondary development is crucial for wood formation in woody plants and that exogenous nitrogen impacts the secondary growth of poplar, my research proposes to investigate the specific effects of nitrogen on cambium development.

Key circadian rhythm genes such as LHY, RVE1, and RVE8 were among these MYB transcription factors. To further validate these findings, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was employed to confirm the expression patterns of these genes. This study lays the groundwork for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of MYB transcription factors in relation to circadian rhythms, which could have broader implications for improving plant growth and development."

Issuing from target-based drug development, calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 inhibitors, collectively named bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs), with excellent efficacies in vitro and in vivo have been generated. Some BKIs including BKI-1748 share a core structure with similarities to the first-generation antiprotozoal drug quinine, which is known to exert notorious side effects. Unlike quinine, BKI-1748 rapidly interfered with C. parvum proliferation in the human colon tumor (HCT) cell line HCT-8 cells and caused dramatic effects on the parasite ultrastructure. To identify putative BKI targets in C. parvum and in host cells, we performed differential affinity chromatography with cell-free extracts from non-infected and infected HCT-8 cells using BKI-1748 and quinine epoxy-activated sepharose columns followed by mass spectrometry. C. parvum proteins of interest were identified in eluates from columns coupled to BKI-1748, or in eluates from both BKI-1748 and quinine columns. However, no C. parvum proteins could be identified binding exclusively to BKI-1748. In contrast, 25 BKI-1748-specific binding proteins originating from HCT-8 cells were detected. Moreover, 29 C. parvum and 224 host cell proteins were identified in both BKI-1748 as well as in quinine eluates. In both C. parvum and host cells, the largest subset of binding proteins was involved in RNA binding and modification, with a focus on ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in RNA splicing. These findings extend previous results, showing that BKI-1748 interacts with putative targets involved in common, essential pathways such as translation and RNA processing.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10931551', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25052707', 'CorpusId': 268166039, 'PubMed': '38473953'}",1,"Given that Cryptosporidium parvum causes persistent diarrhea in humans and animals, the development and evaluation of calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 inhibitors (BKIs) present a promising therapeutic approach.

To uncover potential BKI-1748 targets, differential affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry were employed, revealing that while no exclusive C. parvum proteins bound to BKI-1748, 25 specific host cell proteins from the HCT-8 cell line did. Additionally, proteins involved in RNA binding and modification, particularly ribosomal and splicing proteins, were identified as common binding targets in both the parasite and host cells for BKI-1748 and quinine. These findings suggest that BKI-1748 interacts with crucial pathways related to translation and RNA processing, offering a foundation for further research into its mechanism of action and therapeutic potential."

Very little is known about the physiological role of these proteins. Wild-type and mutant yeast strains deleted in CTP1 and YHM2 were grown in media supplemented with a fermentable (glucose) or a nonfermentable (ethanol) carbon source. To assess changes in Ctp1 and Yhm2 mRNA expression levels, real-time PCR was performed after total RNA extraction. In the wild-type strain, the metabolic switch from the exponential to the stationary phase is associated with an increase in the expression level of the two citrate transporters. In addition, the results obtained in the mutant strains suggest that the presence of a single citrate transporter can partially compensate for the absence of the other. Ctp1 and Yhm2 differently contribute to fermentative and respiratory metabolism. Moreover, the two mitochondrial carriers represent a link between the Krebs cycle and the glyoxylate cycle, which play a key role in the metabolic adaptation strategies of S. cerevisiae.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855732', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031870', 'CorpusId': 267503997, 'PubMed': '38339147'}",1,"Given that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes two distinct mitochondrial carrier proteins, Ctp1 and Yhm2, for citrate transport, this research aims to explore their physiological roles and contributions to metabolic processes.

We have reported in a previous study that nychthemeral dysregulation is associated with an increase in intestinal barrier permeability and inflammation in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. To investigate the effect of circadian rhythm disruption on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota (GM), sixty male C57BL/6J mice were initially divided to two groups, with the shifted group (n = 30) exposed to circadian shifts for three months and the non-shifted group (n = 30) kept under a normal light–dark cycle. The mice of the shifted group were cyclically housed for five days under the normal 12:12 h light–dark cycle, followed by another five days under a reversed light–dark cycle. At the end of the three months, a colitis was induced by 2% DSS given in the drinking water of 30 mice. Animals were then divided into four groups (n = 15 per group): sham group non-shifted (Sham-NS), sham group shifted (Sham-S), DSS non-shifted (DSS-NS) and DSS shifted (DSS-S). Fecal samples were collected from rectal content to investigate changes in GM composition via DNA extraction, followed by high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The mouse GM was dominated by three phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio decreased in mice with induced colitis. The richness and diversity of the GM were reduced in the colitis group, especially in the group with inverted circadian rhythm. Moreover, the GM composition was modified in the inverted circadian rhythm group, with an increase in Alloprevotella, Turicibacter, Bacteroides and Streptococcus genera. Circadian rhythm inversion exacerbates GM dysbiosis to a less rich and diversified extent in a DSS-induced colitis model. These findings show possible interplay between circadian rhythm disruption, GM dynamics and colitis pathogenesis.",2024,Nutrients,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10819604', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020247', 'CorpusId': 267092216, 'PubMed': '38257139'}",1,"Given that circadian rhythm disruption is linked to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation in colitis, our research proposes to explore how alterations in circadian patterns affect gut microbiota (GM) composition and diversity.

The findings suggest that circadian rhythm inversion exacerbates gut microbiota dysbiosis, leading to reduced richness and diversity, particularly in colitic conditions. These results highlight the potential interplay between circadian rhythm disruption, gut microbiota dynamics, and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease."

The pentanucleotide ATTTC repeats occur in hundreds of genes important for various cellular processes, while their insertion and expansion in noncoding regions are associated with neurodegeneration, particularly with subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia and familial adult myoclonic epilepsy. We describe a new striking domain-swapped DNA–DNA interaction triggered by the addition of divalent cations, including Mg2+ and Ca2+. The results of NMR characterization of d(ATTTC)3 in solution show that the oligonucleotide folds into a novel 3D architecture with two central C:C+ base pairs sandwiched between a couple of T:T base pairs. This structural element, referred to here as the TCCTzip, is characterized by intercalative hydrogen-bonding, while the nucleobase moieties are poorly stacked. The 5′- and 3′-ends of TCCTzip motif are connected by stem-loop segments characterized by A:T base pairs and stacking interactions.

However, their effect has been studied primarily in the cortical bone, with vitamin D status being assessed mainly from the total 25(OH)D serum fraction. The study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D (total and free fraction) and iron status (i.e., serum ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor) and calcium intake (ADOS-Ca questionnaire) on lumbar cortical and trabecular bone. In a cohort of 113 male subjects (76 athletes, 37 non-athletes) aged 15–19, the lumbar spine status (Z-score, bone mineral apparent density (BMAD), and trabecular bone score (TBS)) was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Relationships between the examined micronutrients and bone health parameters were observed only in athletes. Free 25(OH)D was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with Z-score and BMAD, while total 25(OH)D (p < 0.001) and iron status (ferritin, Fe stores; p < 0.01) correlated solely with BMAD. Free 25(OH)D and ferritin concentrations were the best determinants of bone status (R2 = 0.330; p < 0.001) and explained 25% and 7% of the BMAD variance, respectively. No relationships were found between the micronutrients and TBS. The results confirmed the positive influence of vitamin D and iron on cortical, but not trabecular, bone status solely in physically active subjects. In athletes, free 25(OH)D seems to be a superior indicator of bone health to a total 25(OH)D fraction.",2024,Nutrients,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10818825', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020215', 'CorpusId': 266917142, 'PubMed': '38257108'}",1,"Given that vitamin D, calcium, and iron are essential for bone health, predominantly studied in cortical bones with vitamin D typically assessed via the total 25(OH)D serum fraction, our research aims to explore their specific impacts on both lumbar cortical and trabecular bone.

There is a dire need to develop an effective vaccine against HIV-1. Understanding the structural proteins of viruses helps in designing a vaccine based on immunogenic peptides. In the current experiment, we identified gp120 epitopes using bioinformatic epitope prediction tools, molecular docking, and MD simulations. The Gb-1 peptide was considered an adjuvant. Consecutive sequences of GTG, GSG, GGTGG, and GGGGS linkers were used to bind the B cell, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL), and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes. The final vaccine construct consisted of 315 amino acids and is expected to be a recombinant protein of approximately 35.49 kDa. Based on docking experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and tertiary structure validation, the analysis of the modeled protein indicates that it possesses a stable structure and can interact with Toll-like receptors. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed vaccine can provoke an immunological response by activating T and B cells, as well as stimulating the release of IgA and IgG antibodies. This vaccine shows potential for HIV-1 prophylaxis.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL, ≥2 miscarriages) affects 1–5% of recognized pregnancies. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the etiologies and pathophysiology of RPL is incomplete, and thus, reliable diagnostic/preventive tools are not yet available. Here, we aimed to define the diagnostic value of three placental proteins for RPL: human chorionic gonadotropin free beta-subunit (free-β-hCG), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), and placental growth factor (PlGF). Blood samples were collected from women with RPL (n = 14) and controls undergoing elective termination of pregnancy (n = 30) at the time of surgery. Maternal serum protein concentrations were measured by BRAHMS KRYPTOR Analyzer. Daily multiple of median (dMoM) values were calculated for gestational age-specific normalization. To obtain classifiers, logistic regression analysis was performed, and ROC curves were calculated. There were differences in changes of maternal serum protein concentrations with advancing healthy gestation. Between 6 and 13 weeks, women with RPL had lower concentrations and dMoMs of free β-hCG, PAPP-A, and PlGF than controls. PAPP-A dMoM had the best discriminative properties (AUC = 0.880). Between 9 and 13 weeks, discriminative properties of all protein dMoMs were excellent (free β-hCG: AUC = 0.975; PAPP-A: AUC = 0.998; PlGF: AUC = 0.924). In conclusion, free-β-hCG and PAPP-A are valuable biomarkers for RPL, especially between 9 and 13 weeks.

The effect of six antioxidants at a concentration of 1 μM on the replicative lifespan of human dermal fibroblasts was studied. The nitroxide 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL), ergothioneine, and Trolox extended the replicative lifespan (RLS) (40 ± 1 population doublings (PD)) by 7 ± 2, 4 ± 1, and 3 ± 1 PD and lowered the expression of p21 at late passages. Coumaric acid, curcumin and resveratrol did not affect the RLS . The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was decreased or not affected by the antioxidants although TEMPOL and coumaric acid decreased the level of glutathione. Only ergothioneine and resveratrol decreased the level of protein carbonylation. The antioxidants that could prolong the RLS elevated the mitochondrial membrane potential.

However, the role of BRDs in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids (UFs) is entirely unknown. The present study aimed to determine the expression pattern of BRD9 in UFs and matched myometrium and further assess the impact of a BRD9 inhibitor on UF phenotype and epigenetic/epitranscriptomic changes. Our studies demonstrated that the levels of BRD9 were significantly upregulated in UFs compared to matched myometrium, suggesting that the aberrant BRD expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of UFs. We then evaluated the potential roles of BRD9 using its specific inhibitor, I-BRD9. Targeted inhibition of BRD9 suppressed UF tumorigenesis with increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, decreased cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix deposition in UF cells. The latter is the key hallmark of UFs. Unbiased transcriptomic profiling coupled with downstream bioinformatics analysis further and extensively demonstrated that targeted inhibition of BRD9 impacted the cell cycle- and ECM-related biological pathways and reprogrammed the UF cell epigenome and epitranscriptome in UFs. Taken together, our studies support the critical role of BRD9 in UF cells and the strong interconnection between BRD9 and other pathways controlling the UF progression.

This study investigated the effect of IAP treatment on experimental colitis in mice subjected to forced exercise on a high-fat diet. C57BL/6 mice with TNBS colitis were fed a high-fat diet and subjected to forced treadmill exercise with or without IAP treatment. Disease activity, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota were assessed. Forced exercise exacerbated colitis in obese mice, as evidenced by increased disease activity index (DAI), oxidative stress markers, and proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines. IAP treatment significantly reduced these effects and promoted the expression of barrier proteins in the colonic mucosa. Additionally, IAP treatment altered the gut microbiota composition, favoring beneficial Verrucomicrobiota and reducing pathogenic Clostridia and Odoribacter.

Our study included 151 melanoma patients; of these, 83 were without metastasis and 68 with metastases. Plasma samples were analyzed using a targeted Lipidyzer™ platform, covering 13 lipid classes and over 1100 lipid species. Following quality control filters, 802 lipid species were included in the subsequent analyses. Total plasma lipid contents were significantly reduced in patients with metastasis. Specifically, levels of two out of the thirteen lipid classes (free fatty acids (FFAs) and lactosylceramides (LCERs)) were significantly decreased in patients with metastasis. Three lipids (CE(12:0), FFA(24:1), and TAG47:2-FA16:1) were identified as more effective predictors of melanoma metastasis than the well-known markers LDH and S100B. Furthermore, the predictive value substantially improved upon combining the lipid markers. We observed an increase in the cumulative levels of five lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC(16:0); LPC(18:0); LPC(18:1); LPC(18:2); LPC(20:4)), each individually associated with an elevated risk of lymph node metastasis but not cutaneous or distant metastasis. Additionally, seventeen lipid molecules were linked to patient survival, four of which (CE(12:0), CE(14:0), CE(15:0), SM(14:0)) overlapped with the lipid panel predicting metastasis.

Bioprinting and most alternative technologies rely on animal-derived materials, which compromises the intent of animal welfare and results in the generation of chimeric systems of limited value. The current study therefore presents the first bioprinted liver model that is entirely void of animal-derived constituents. Initially, HuH-7 cells underwent adaptation to a chemically defined medium (CDM). The adapted cells exhibited high survival rates (85–92%) after cryopreservation in chemically defined freezing media, comparable to those preserved in standard medium (86–92%). Xeno-free bioink for 3D bioprinting yielded liver models with high relative cell viability (97–101%), akin to a Matrigel-based liver model (83–102%) after 15 days of culture. The established xeno-free model was used for toxicity testing of a marine biotoxin, okadaic acid (OA). In 2D culture, OA toxicity was virtually identical for cells cultured under standard conditions and in CDM. In the xeno-free bioprinted liver model, 3-fold higher concentrations of OA than in the respective monolayer culture were needed to induce cytotoxicity.

This new xeno-free liver model was effectively utilized for marine biotoxin toxicity testing, showing higher resistance to cytotoxicity compared to 2D cultures. These findings suggest that xeno-free bioprinted models could serve as a viable alternative for research and toxicity testing, enhancing both ethical standards and experimental relevance."

The primary aim of this study was to assess differences in the human tear metabolome and lipidome between OA and healthy controls (HCs) across peak allergy (spring–summer) and off-peak (autumn–winter) seasons in Victoria, Australia. A total of 19 participants (14 OA, 5 HCs) aged 18–45 were recruited and grouped by allergy questionnaire score. Metabolites and lipids from tear samples were analysed using mass spectrometry. Data were analysed using TraceFinder and Metaboanalyst. Metabolomics analysis showed 12 differentially expressed (DE) metabolites between those with OA and the HCs during the peak allergy season, and 24 DE metabolites were found in the off-peak season. The expression of niacinamide was upregulated in OA sufferers vs. HCs across both seasons (p ≤ 0.05). A total of 6 DE lipids were DE between those with OA and the HCs during the peak season, and 24 were DE in the off-peak season. Dysregulated metabolites affected oxidative stress, inflammation, and homeostasis across seasons, suggesting a link between OA-associated itch and ocular surface damage via eye rubbing.

Lutein has antioxidant properties and is the main component of macular pigment essential for protecting the retina, but has low bioavailability, thereby limiting its potential as a nutritional supplement. Oil-in-water emulsions have been used as lutein delivery systems. In particular, octenylsuccinated (OS) starch is a biopolymer-derived emulsifier safe to use in infant foods, while exhibiting superior emulsifying capacity. This study determined the effects of an OS starch-stabilized lutein emulsion on lutein bioavailability in Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats. In an acute study, 10-day-old pups received a single oral dose of free lutein or lutein emulsion, with subsequent blood sampling over 24 h to analyze pharmacokinetics. The lutein emulsion group had a 2.12- and 1.91-fold higher maximum serum lutein concentration and area under the curve, respectively, compared to the free lutein group. In two daily dosing studies, oral lutein was given from postnatal day 5 to 18. Blood and tissue lutein concentrations were measured. The results indicated that the daily intake of lutein emulsion led to a higher lutein concentration in circulation and key tissues compared to free lutein. The OS starch-stabilized emulsion could be an effective and safe lutein delivery system for newborns.",2024,Nutrients,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10857328', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16030422', 'CorpusId': 267368682, 'PubMed': '38337704'}",1,"Given that newborns' eyes and brains are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress and that lutein, despite its essential role in protecting the retina, has low bioavailability, this study investigates the potential of an octenylsuccinated (OS) starch-stabilized lutein emulsion to enhance lutein bioavailability.

To help understand the biological functions of these microorganisms, complete genome sequencing is routinely used. Nevertheless, the proper prediction of their gene catalogue is challenging due to their taxon-specific evolutionary features. As innovative genome annotation strategies are needed to obtain a representative snapshot of the overall lifestyle of these parasites, the MicroAnnot tool, a dedicated workflow for microsporidian sequence annotation using data from curated databases of accurately annotated microsporidian genes, has been developed. Furthermore, specific modules have been implemented to perform small gene (<300 bp) and transposable element identification. Finally, functional annotation was performed using the signature-based InterProScan software. MicroAnnot’s accuracy has been verified by the re-annotation of four microsporidian genomes for which structural annotation had previously been validated.

However, little is known as to how PNKP functions in such diverse repair processes. Here we report that PNKP is acetylated at K142 (AcK142) by p300 constitutively but at K226 (AcK226) by CBP, only after DSB induction. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using AcK142 or AcK226 PNKP-specific antibodies showed that AcK142-PNKP associates only with BER/SSBR, and AcK226 PNKP with DSBR proteins. Despite the modest effect of acetylation on PNKP’s enzymatic activity in vitro, cells expressing non-acetylable PNKP (K142R or K226R) accumulated DNA damage in transcribed genes. Intriguingly, in striatal neuronal cells of a Huntington's Disease (HD)-based mouse model, K142, but not K226, was acetylated. This is consistent with the reported degradation of CBP, but not p300, in HD cells. Moreover, transcribed genomes of HD cells progressively accumulated DSBs. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the association of Ac-PNKP with the transcribed genes, consistent with PNKP’s role in transcription-coupled repair. Thus, our findings demonstrate that acetylation at two lysine residues, located in different domains of PNKP, regulates its distinct role in BER/SSBR versus DSBR.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10954452', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae002', 'CorpusId': 266983646, 'PubMed': '38224455'}",1,"Given that mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase (PNKP) plays a crucial role in various DNA repair pathways, our research hypothesizes that the acetylation of PNKP at specific lysine residues is a regulatory mechanism that determines its involvement in distinct DNA repair processes. This study reveals that acetylation at K142 by p300 is linked to base excision and single-strand break repair, while acetylation at K226 by CBP, which occurs post-double-strand break induction, is associated with double-strand break repair. Furthermore, the differential acetylation of PNKP is critical in transcription-coupled repair, with implications for neurodegenerative conditions such as Huntington's Disease, where selective acetylation patterns correlate with the accumulation of DNA damage. These findings suggest that targeted modulation of PNKP acetylation could be a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing DNA repair fidelity in disease contexts."

Metabolic regulation in accumulated senescent cells (SnCs) with aging is essential for tissue homeostasis, and adequate ATP is important in cell activation for aged tissue repair. Strategies for ATP metabolism intervention hold prospects for therapeutic advances. Here, we found energy metabolic changes in aging skin from patients and mice. Our data show that metformin engineered EV (Met-EV) can enhance aged mouse skin repair, as well as ameliorate cellular senescence and restore cell dysfunctions. Notably, ATP metabolism was remodeled as reduced glycolysis and enhanced OXPHOS after Met-EV treatment. We show Met-EV rescue senescence-induced mitochondria dysfunctions and mitophagy suppressions, indicating the role of Met-EV in remodeling mitochondrial functions via mitophagy for adequate ATP production in aged tissue repair.

Using an animal model which accurately reflects human infection without the need to alter the host microbiome or the immune system prior to infection, we explored pathophysiological alterations of the gut after C. jejuni infection. Our study identified the gut metabolite L-lactate as playing an important role as a growth substrate for C. jejuni during acute infection.

Evidence has been growing more recently on the toxic synergy between light and pollutants. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) originate from the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Some PAHs, such as the Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), absorb ultraviolet A (UVA) wavelengths and can act as exogenous chromophores, leading to synergistic toxicity through DNA damage and cytotoxicity concomitant to ROS formation. In this study, we shed light on the mechanism underlying the toxic synergy between PAHs and UVA. Using dermal fibroblasts co-exposed to UVA and BaP, we have demonstrated that the photosensitization reaction causes mortality, which is most likely caused by ROS accumulation. We have shown that these ROS are concentrated in the lipids, which causes an important induction of lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde, by-products of lipid peroxidation. We have also shown the accumulation of bulky DNA damage, most likely generated by these by-products of lipid peroxidation. To our knowledge, this study represents the first one depicting the molecular effects of photo-pollution on dermal skin.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10856043', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031905', 'CorpusId': 267505319, 'PubMed': '38339182'}",1,"Given that light and atmospheric pollution independently contribute to cancer and premature aging, recent evidence suggests a toxic synergy between these factors, particularly involving polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and ultraviolet A (UVA) light.

Using Escherichia coli lineages spanning 50,000 generations of evolution, we quantify the fitness effects of insertion mutations in every gene. Macroscopically, the fraction of deleterious mutations changed little over time whereas the beneficial tail declined sharply, approaching an exponential distribution. Microscopically, changes in individual gene essentiality and deleterious effects often occurred in parallel; altered essentiality is only partly explained by structural variation. The identity and effect sizes of beneficial mutations changed rapidly over time, but many targets of selection remained predictable because of the importance of loss-of-function mutations. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic—but statistically predictable—nature of mutational fitness effects. Editor’s summary The benefits and costs of mutations that undergo natural selection can change depending on genetic interactions with subsequent mutations. In an enduring experiment, 12 lineages of Escherichia coli have been maintained for more than 75,000 generations, with each generation sampled and preserved. Couce et al. made transposon insertion libraries in ancestral and evolved strains taken at the 50,000 generation point and measured fitness in competition experiments using these samples. The numbers of beneficial mutations rapidly tailed off during long-term passage, with parallel changes in fitness cost and gene essentiality occurring across the lineages. The authors found nonessential genes that became essential and essential genes that became nonessential in all lineages. Predictability stemmed from the importance of loss-of-function mutations that scale with the length of the target genes. —Caroline Ash Predictable and parallel changes occur in the fitness effects of mutations in Escherichia coli over 50,000 generations. INTRODUCTION Evolution is constrained by the mutations accessible to natural selection. The benefits and costs of these mutations are described by the distribution of fitness effects (DFE). The DFE governs the tempo and mode of adaptation by capturing the fitness landscape of the local mutational neighborhood and reflects the mutational robustness of genotypes. However, the DFE need not remain static over evolution; with every accumulating mutation, the effects and accessibility of subsequent mutations may change through genetic interactions. Understanding how the DFE changes is important for models that seek to explain the speed of adaptation, maintenance of genetic diversity, and pace of the molecular clock. RATIONALE We quantified the effects of hundreds of thousands of insertion mutations in 12 populations of Escherichia coli through 50,000 generations of experimental evolution. We generated high-coverage transposon insertion libraries in the ancestral and evolved strains and measured the fitness effects of these mutations in bulk competitions. We characterized both the statistical properties of the DFEs and the effects of mutations in specific genes. RESULTS We saw no systematic change in the deleterious tail of the DFE. By contrast, the fraction of beneficial mutations declined rapidly, with its form approaching an exponentially distributed tail. At the gene level, we saw frequent changes in the fitness effects of insertion mutations in specific genes. Both the genetic identity and effect sizes of beneficial mutations changed over time. In the deleterious tail, there were frequent changes in the costs of specific mutations and even in gene essentiality. These changes often evolved in parallel across lineages and the changes in essentiality were only partially explained by structural variation. Despite pervasive changes in the fitness effects of particular mutations over time, many targets of selection could still be predicted by combining gene length with the ancestral DFE, owing to the benefit conferred by loss-of-function mutations during early adaptation. CONCLUSION Overall, the high-level features of the fitness landscape were largely unchanged over this multi-decade evolution experiment, except for truncation of the beneficial tail of the DFE. Over the short term, the drivers of adaptation were often predictable from the gene-level details of the DFE, especially combined with the length of genes available for beneficial mutations. As the populations accumulated more mutations over longer timescales, pervasive epistasis led to changes in the magnitude and even the sign of the fitness effects of many mutations, making some previously advantageous mutations deleterious and vice versa. Consequently, some evolutionary paths that were inaccessible to the ancestor became accessible to the evolving populations, while others were closed off. Moreover, many of the changes in the fitness effects of particular mutations, both beneficial and deleterious, occurred in parallel across the replicate populations. Thus, some features of the DFEs changed repeatedly and predictably over time, even as the overall form of the fitness landscape was largely unchanged. Taken together, our results demonstrate the dynamic—but often statistically predictable—nature of mutational fitness effects. Changing distribution of fitness effects over evolution. Transposon mutagenesis of E. coli strains from a long-term evolution experiment and bulk fitness assays enable characterization of genome-wide and gene-level distribution of fitness effects (DFE). The overall shape of the DFE is conserved, except for a declining beneficial tail, while the effects of specific mutations and gene essentiality often evolve in parallel across populations. The ancestral DFE, combined with gene length, predicts drivers of adaptation.",2024,Science,2,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.add1417', 'CorpusId': 267212246, 'PubMed': '38271521'}",1,"Given that the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is crucial in shaping evolutionary processes, I propose to investigate how DFEs change over time as organisms adapt.

Additionally, gene essentiality and the fitness costs of specific mutations often evolve in parallel across different lineages. Despite these dynamic changes, many selective targets remain predictable due to the importance of loss-of-function mutations, which are influenced by gene length and the ancestral DFE. This study highlights the dynamic yet statistically predictable nature of mutational fitness effects and suggests a framework for anticipating evolutionary trajectories based on initial genetic landscapes."

This microorganism can also easily acquire antibiotic resistance determinants, making the treatment of infections a big challenge, and has the ability to persist in the hospital environment under a wide range of conditions. The objective of this work was to study the molecular epidemiology and genetic characteristics of two blaOXA24/40 Acinetobacter baumannii outbreaks (2009 and 2020-21) at a tertiary hospital in Northern Spain. Thirty-six isolates were investigated and genotypically screened by Whole Genome Sequencing to analyse the resistome and virulome. Isolates were resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing analysis identified that Outbreak 1 was mainly produced by isolates belonging to ST3Pas/ST106Oxf (IC3) containing blaOXA24/40, blaOXA71 and blaADC119. Outbreak 2 isolates were exclusively ST2Pas/ST801Oxf (IC2) blaOXA24/40, blaOXA66 and blaADC30, the same genotype seen in two isolates from 2009. Virulome analysis showed that IC2 isolates contained genes for capsular polysaccharide KL32 and lipooligosacharide OCL5. A 8.9 Kb plasmid encoding the blaOXA24/40 gene was common in all isolates.

Phenolic compounds have demonstrated the ability to slow down the aging process of the brain due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study assessed the protective properties of catechin and polyphenon-60 in non-pathologically aged rats regarding visuo-spatial learning and the oxidative status of the frontal cortex. Old animals were treated with catechin or green tea extract (polyphenon-60) for 36 days, daily. Healthy old and young rats were used as controls. During the first training phase, treated rats executed the test better, locating the target in less time compared with the controls. Biomarkers of oxidative stress (catalase activities, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase) were reduced in the brain of old animals, although their activities were partially improved after both antioxidant treatments. Furthermore, the rise in the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels—a marker of lipid peroxidation—in the frontal cortex of aged animals was significantly ameliorated after the interventions.

Although the Dof TF has been identified in a variety of species, its systemic analysis in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is lacking and its potential role in abiotic stress responses remains unclear. A total of 36 potential Dof genes in potato were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in this work. Five phylogenetic groups can be formed from these 36 Dof proteins. An analysis of cis-acting elements revealed the potential roles of Dofs in potato development, including under numerous abiotic stress conditions. The cycling Dof factors (CDFs) might be the initial step in the abiotic stress response signaling cascade. In potato, five CDFs (StCDF1/StDof19, StCDF2/StDof4, StCDF3/StDof11, StCDF4/StDof24, and StCDF5/StDof15) were identified, which are homologs of Arabidopsis CDFs. The results revealed that these genes were engaged in a variety of abiotic reactions.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the temporospatial expression of aquaglyceroporins (AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9) in the bovine (Bos taurus) reproductive system using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The study also included morphological analysis and identification of GATA-4. In brief, in immature individuals, AQP3 and AQP7 were found in gonocytes. In reproductive bulls, AQP3 was observed in spermatocytes and spermatogonia, while AQP7 was visible in all germ cells and the Sertoli cells. AQP7 and AQP9 were detected in the Leydig cells. Along the entire epididymis of reproductive bulls, aquaglyceroporins were visible, among others, in basal cells (AQP3 and AQP7), in epididymal sperm (AQP7) and in the stereocilia of the principal cells (AQP9). In males of all ages, aquaglyceroporins were identified in the principal and basal cells of the vas deferens. An increase in the expression of AQP3 in the testis and cauda epididymis and a decrease in the abundance of AQP7 in the vas deferens with age were found.

In this study, PIP3 was examined in its free form or as a complex with cationic starch (Q-starch) as a carrier. The intracellular bioactivity and localization of free PIP3 and the Q-starch/PIP3 complexes were examined. Our results present the capability of Q-starch to form complexes with PIP3, facilitate its cellular membrane internalization, and activate intracellular paths leading to enhanced wound healing. Both free PIP3 and Q-starch/PIP3 complexes enhanced monolayer gap closure in scratch assays and induced amplified collagen production within HaCAT and BJ fibroblast cells. Western blot presented enhanced AKT activation by free or complexed PIP3 in BJ fibroblasts in which endogenous PIP3 production was pharmacologically inhibited. Furthermore, both free PIP3 and Q-starch/PIP3 complexes expedited wound closure in mice, after single or daily dermal injections into the wound margins. Free PIP3 and the Q-starch/PIP3 complexes inherently activated the AKT signaling pathway, which is responsible for crucial wound healing processes such as migration; this was also observed in wound assays in mice.

Whether commonly consumed plant-based diets are nutritionally adequate for maximal muscular hypertrophy remains unknown. This modeling study assessed the nutrient composition of completely plant-based diets scaled to the caloric demands of maximal muscle mass and strength development in adult male bodybuilders. To model calorie requirements, anthropometric data from bodybuilders were input into the Tinsley resting metabolic rate prediction equation, and an appropriate physical activity factor and calorie surplus were applied. Dietary data from a large cohort following completely plant-based diets were then scaled to meet these needs. Modeled intakes for nutrients of interest were calculated as 1.8 g/kg/day of protein and 2.75 g/meal of leucine, which surpass mean requirements for maximal increases in muscle mass and strength and muscle protein synthesis, respectively. Daily levels for all micronutrients, except vitamin D, also exceeded requirements. Saturated fat levels were aligned with dietary guidelines, although sodium levels exceeded recommended limits.

We hypothesized that 14-day treatment with ketone ester (KE) would improve resting and exercise hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind cross-over study, nondiabetic patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction received 14-day KE and 14-day isocaloric non-KE comparator regimens of 4 daily doses separated by a 14-day washout period. After each treatment period, participants underwent right heart catheterization, echocardiography, and blood sampling at plasma trough levels and after dosing. Participants underwent an exercise hemodynamic assessment after a second dosing. The primary end point was resting cardiac output (CO). Secondary end points included resting and exercise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and peak exercise CO and metabolic equivalents. RESULTS: We included 24 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (17 men; 65±9 years of age; all White). Resting CO at trough levels was higher after KE compared with isocaloric comparator (5.2±1.1 L/min versus 5.0±1.1 L/min; difference, 0.3 L/min [95% CI, 0.1–0.5), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was lower (8±3 mm Hg versus 11±3 mm Hg; difference, −2 mm Hg [95% CI, −4 to −1]). These changes were amplified after KE dosing. Across all exercise intensities, KE treatment was associated with lower mean exercise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (−3 mm Hg [95% CI, −5 to −1] ) and higher mean CO (0.5 L/min [95% CI, 0.1–0.8]), significantly different at low to moderate steady-state exercise but not at peak. Metabolic equivalents remained similar between treatments. In exploratory analyses, KE treatment was associated with 18% lower NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; difference, −98 ng/L [95% CI, −185 to −23]), higher left ventricular ejection fraction (37±5 versus 34±5%; P=0.01), and lower left atrial and ventricular volumes. CONCLUSIONS: KE treatment for 14 days was associated with higher CO at rest and lower filling pressures, cardiac volumes, and NT-proBNP levels compared with isocaloric comparator. These changes persisted during exercise and were achieved on top of optimal medical therapy. Sustained modulation of circulating ketone bodies is a potential treatment principle in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

In this study, we evaluated the role of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) as a potential ITAF for the HIV-1 IRES. In HIV-1-expressing cells, the depletion of hnRNPK reduced HIV-1 vRNA translation. Furthermore, both the depletion and overexpression of hnRNPK modulated HIV-1 IRES activity. Phosphorylations and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1)-induced asymmetrical dimethylation (aDMA) of hnRNPK strongly impacted the protein's ability to promote the activity of the HIV-1 IRES. We also show that hnRNPK acts as an ITAF for the human T cell lymphotropic virus-type 1 (HTLV-1) IRES, present in the 5′UTR of the viral sense mRNA, but not for the IRES present in the antisense spliced transcript encoding the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper protein (sHBZ).

We identified the SOS-regulated TisB protein as the unique molecular determinant responsible for cytoplasmic condensation, proton motive force dissipation, loss of pH homeostasis, and H2O2 accumulation in Escherichia coli cells treated with high doses of ofloxacin. However, TisB is not required for high doses of ofloxacin to interfere with the function of DNA gyrase or the resulting rapid inhibition of DNA replication and lethal DNA damage.

Using comparative genomics and sequence-structure analyses, we show that the DndABCDE module is commonly functionally decoupled from the DndFGH module. However, the modification gene-neighborhoods encode other nucleases, potentially acting as the actual restriction components or suicide effectors limiting propagation of the selfish elements. The modification module's core consists of a coevolving gene-pair encoding the DNA-scanning apparatus – a DndD/CxC-clade ABC ATPase and DndE with two ribbon-helix-helix (MetJ/Arc) DNA-binding domains. Diversification of DndE’s DNA-binding interface suggests a multiplicity of target specificities. Additionally, many systems feature DNA cytosine methylase genes instead of PT modification, indicating the DndDE core can recruit other nucleobase modifications. We show that DndFGH is a distinct counter-invader system with several previously uncharacterized domains, including a nucleotide kinase. These likely trigger its restriction endonuclease domain in response to multiple stimuli, like nucleotides, while blocking protective modifications by invader methylases. Remarkably, different DndH variants contain a HerA/FtsK ATPase domain acquired from multiple sources, including cellular genome-segregation systems and mobile elements.

Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, positively regulate brassinosteroid responses. Our results uncover an elusive export mechanism for bioactive brassinosteroids that is tightly coordinated with brassinosteroid signaling. Editor’s summary The plant ABC transporter ABCB19 has long been implicated in auxin transport. Ying et al. found an alternative role for ABCB19 as a transporter of another hormone group, brassinosteroids. The authors determined the cryoelectron microscopy structure and found a hydrophobic pocket where brassinolides can bind. They also demonstrated that brassinosteroids triggered ABCB19 ATP hydrolase activity and that mutating specific amino acids in the ABCB19 protein disrupted brassinosteroid transport. The work challenges the auxin-focused view of ABCB19 function and provides an explanation for how brassinosteroids might be exported out of cells to the site of their perception. —Madeleine Seale Biochemical, in planta, and structural analyses demonstrate that ABCB19 is a brassinosteroid exporter. INTRODUCTION Brassinosteroids are steroidal phytohormones essential for plant growth and development and for response to environmental stresses. The brassinosteroid signaling pathway has been well studied, and key membrane-localized receptors, co-receptors, and downstream factors have been identified and characterized. Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but perceived in the apoplast through binding to the extracellular part of the plasma membrane–localized receptor complex, which initiates the signaling pathway. As polar molecules, the bioactive brassinosteroids might not easily permeate the cell membrane through simple diffusion. The mechanism by which the intracellularly synthesized brassinosteroids are exported remains elusive. The Arabidopsis ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB19 has been proposed to play a role in the distribution and export of another classical phytohormone, auxin, but its substrate specificity awaits thorough investigation. RATIONALE In this work, we tested the ATPase activities of the Arabidopsis ABCB19 in the presence of different phytohormones, including auxins and brassinosteroids. Next, the binding affinities between ABCB19 and bioactive brassinosteroids were determined. In vitro proteoliposome-based and in vivo protoplast-based assays were used to evaluate the transport of brassinosteroids by ABCB19. Structural analyses were performed for the wild-type ABCB19 and the ATPase inactive mutant in the ATP-bound state in the absence or presence of brassinosteroids. Genetic analyses were performed to confirm the role of ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, in brassinosteroid signaling. RESULTS The ATPase activity of ABCB19 can be stimulated by the bioactive brassinosteroids in a dose-dependent manner, but not by auxins or the brassinosteroid biosynthesis precursors. The binding affinities between ABCB19 and the bioactive brassinosteroids are at micromolar range, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Proteoliposome-based and Arabidopsis protoplast–based transport assays both proved that ABCB19 can transport brassinosteroids. The structures of ABCB19 revealed a typical architecture of the type IV ABC transporters, consisting of two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains. An extra regulatory domain was identified between the transmembrane domains and may play an inhibitory role in ABCB19 activity regulation. The brassinosteroid molecule binds to an intracellularly facing cavity in the transmembrane region of ABCB19 through both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The abcb1 abcb19 double mutant resembled the brassinosteroid biosynthetic mutants with decreased brassinosteroid signaling and was insensitive to the application of either brassinolide or the biosynthetic precursor 22-hydroxycampesterol. By contrast, plants overexpressing ABCB1 or ABCB19 show increased brassinosteroid signaling. Moreover, the plasma membrane abundance of ABCB1 and ABCB19 was regulated by brassinosteroids. CONCLUSION In vivo and in vitro analyses collectively show that the Arabidopsis ABC transporter ABCB19 functions as a brassinosteroid exporter and positively regulates brassinosteroid signaling together with ABCB1. The determined structures provide insights into the molecular architecture of ABCB19 and how it recognizes the brassinosteroid molecule. These results provide a basis for further investigations on the control of ABCB19 transport activity by phosphorylation of its regulatory domain, and pave the way for future studies of both auxin and brassinosteroid transport and their signaling cross-talk in plants. Model of brassinosteroid export and signaling in plants. Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior, likely in the endoplasmic reticulum, where most of the biosynthetic enzymes are localized.

Structural analyses revealed that ABCB19 can bind brassinosteroids, triggering its ATPase activity and enabling their transport. Further, genetic and biochemical assays in Arabidopsis demonstrated that both ABCB19 and its homolog ABCB1 positively regulate brassinosteroid signaling.

However, the regulation mechanism of bHLH transcription factors in balancing anthocyanin biosynthesis and abiotic stress in sweet potato (Ipomoea batata (L.) Lam.) remains unclear. Previously, transcriptome analysis revealed the genes that were differentially expressed among the purple-fleshed sweet potato cultivar ‘Jingshu 6’ and its anthocyanin-rich mutant ‘JS6-5’. Here, we selected one of these potential genes, IbMYC2, which belongs to the bHLH transcription factor family, for subsequent analyses. The expression of IbMYC2 in the JS6-5 storage roots is almost four-fold higher than Jingshu 6 and significantly induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), NaCl, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)6000. Overexpression of IbMYC2 significantly enhances anthocyanin production and exhibits a certain antioxidant capacity, thereby improving salt and drought tolerance. In contrast, reducing IbMYC2 expression increases its susceptibility. Our data showed that IbMYC2 could elevate the expression of anthocyanin synthesis pathway genes by binding to IbCHI and IbDFR promoters. Additionally, overexpressing IbMYC2 activates genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging and proline synthesis enzymes under salt and drought conditions.

However, the influence of genetic variation in immunosurveillance on cancer risk is not well understood. Leveraging population-level data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we show that heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II loci is associated with reduced lung cancer risk in smokers. Fine-mapping implicated amino acid heterozygosity in the HLA-II peptide binding groove in reduced lung cancer risk, and single-cell analyses showed that smoking drives enrichment of proinflammatory lung macrophages and HLA-II+ epithelial cells. In lung cancer, widespread loss of HLA-II heterozygosity (LOH) favored loss of alleles with larger neopeptide repertoires. Thus, our findings nominate genetic variation in immunosurveillance as a critical risk factor for lung cancer. Editor’s summary Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are cell surface molecules that recognize antigenic peptides and present them to T cells to initiate an immune response. Krishna et al. performed an immunogenetic analysis of associations between HLA class II loci and lung cancer risk. They analyzed two large population-level datasets, one from the UK Biobank and the other from Finland’s FinnGen. Heterozygosity at HLA class II loci was found to be associated with reduced risk of developing lung cancer. Individuals who were current or former smokers benefited from this protective effect, but individuals who had never smoked did not. Smokers with lung cancer were found to have somatic loss of HLA class II heterozygosity, suggesting a functional role for HLA-related immune surveillance in cancer risk. —Priscilla N. Kelly Genomic and epidemiological analyses reveal that HLA class II heterozygosity is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer in smokers. INTRODUCTION Whether the host immune system naturally protects against cancer has long been the subject of intense debate. The cancer immunosurveillance theory ascribes a protective function to the adaptive immune system, whereby T cell–mediated recognition of neoantigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex suppresses early neoplasia. Studies in mice have provided support for the cancer immunosurveillance theory, yet evidence for a protective role of the immune system against cancer in humans has been relatively lacking. In lung cancer, genetic variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is linked to tumor evolution and treatment outcomes, but whether HLA polymorphisms reduce lung cancer risk—which would imply a role of the host immune system in preventing lung cancer—is currently unclear. Population-scale biobank analysis coupling host genetics with longitudinal clinical data enables a systematic investigation of how HLA polymorphism influences lung cancer risk together with smoking and other established risk factors. RATIONALE Understanding the molecular determinants of cancer risk is critical for early cancer detection and strategies to limit cancer mortality. Tobacco smoking increases lung cancer risk and is associated with a heightened somatic mutation rate that drives neoplastic potential, but whether there are additional risk factors that further modify lung cancer susceptibility, even among smokers, is unclear. The HLA heterozygote advantage theory posits that an HLA genotype encoding two different allomorphs enables presentation of a more diverse antigenic peptide repertoire to the immune system—and subsequent superior immune control of infected or cancerous cells—than does an HLA genotype encoding two equivalent allomorphs. Thus, heterozygous HLA allomorphs may present more neoantigens arising from smoking-derived somatic mutations. In this study, we evaluated the effect of HLA heterozygosity on lung cancer risk, leveraging genetic and longitudinal clinical data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen together with multimodal genomic analyses of nonmalignant and lung tumor samples. RESULTS In both the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we found that heterozygosity at the HLA class II (HLA-II) loci was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer over more than a decade of follow-up. HLA-II heterozygosity was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer in both current and former but not never-smokers, suggesting that smoking-derived antigens may augment the immune response to early neoplastic disease. HLA-II homozygosity conferred substantial lifetime risk of disease (e.g., in the UK Biobank, 13.9% for current smokers homozygous at HLA-DRB1) and was independent of known clinical and genetic risk factors, including a genome-wide polygenic risk score. Heterozygosity of amino acid sites within the HLA-II peptide binding groove was also associated with reduced risk of lung cancer, whereas analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from nonmalignant and tumor lung samples showed that lung macrophages and epithelial cells express HLA-II and are affected by smoking. Analysis of tumor genomes from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) cohort, and Hartwig Medical Foundation cohort revealed widespread loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the HLA-II loci in lung cancer, with rates of LOH equaling those of HLA-I. An analysis of neoantigen repertoires between lung cancer tumors with and without HLA-II LOH showed that HLA-II LOH favors the loss of alleles with larger neopeptide repertoires, underscoring the importance of the HLA-II loci and the CD4+ T cell response in lung cancer. CONCLUSION The association of HLA-II heterozygosity with reduced risk of lung cancer implies that genetic variation in immunosurveillance is a feature of cancer susceptibility, together with environmental exposures, hereditary risk, and DNA replication errors. Our findings broaden understanding of the role of the host immune system in cancer risk and may motivate the incorporation of immunogenetics into lung cancer screening programs. The immunogenetics of lung cancer risk. Genetic epidemiological analyses in the UK Biobank and FinnGen coupled with multimodal genomics reveal that HLA-II heterozygosity is associated with reduced lung cancer risk in smokers. The data suggest that heterozygous HLA allomorphs promote immune control of early neoplasia through presentation of diverse smoking-related antigens.

Cytokine signaling through the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway correlates with checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. We report a phase I clinical trial of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib with anti–PD-1 antibody nivolumab in Hodgkin lymphoma patients relapsed or refractory following checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. The combination yielded a best overall response rate of 53% (10/19). Ruxolitinib significantly reduced neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and percentages of myeloid suppressor cells but increased numbers of cytokine-producing T cells. Ruxolitinib rescued the function of exhausted T cells and enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical solid tumor and lymphoma models. This synergy was characterized by a switch from suppressive to immunostimulatory myeloid cells, which enhanced T cell division. Editor’s summary Cancer immunotherapy is a type of treatment that mobilizes a patient’s immune system to kill tumor cells. It has been successful in treating certain tumors, but patients frequently have chronic inflammation and immunosuppression, which can limit treatment response. Two independent clinical trials looked at whether dialing down inflammation using drugs called JAK inhibitors could improve the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in cancer patients (see the Perspective by Gadina and O’Shea). Mathew et al. conducted a phase 2 trial to investigate the drug combination as a first-line therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Delayed administration of itacitinib after treatment with pembrolizumab improved therapeutic response. Zak et al. performed a phase 1/2 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A combination of ruxolitinib and nivolumab resulted in improved clinical efficacy in patients who had previously failed checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Checkpoint immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment in the past decade for many cancer patients. Despite durable responses in some patients, many either fail to respond or develop resistance to the current immunotherapy regimens. Thus, a substantial unmet clinical need remains in nonresponsive patients to reinvigorate checkpoint immunotherapy responses. RATIONALE T cell exhaustion limits current responses to immunotherapy. Using the results of a high-throughput screen for small molecules reversing T cell exhaustion, we explored the hypothesis that a small molecule could enhance antitumor T cell responses and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy in cancer. RESULTS Following the screening of the ReFrame library in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Clone 13 (Cl13) model of immune suppression, we identified a preponderance of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis), which could dramatically rescue the function of exhausted T cells. Using the first clinically approved JAKi, ruxolitinib, we demonstrated that, rather than suppress the immune response, JAK inhibition could enhance T and NK cell numbers and function in Cl13 as well as syngeneic tumor models and enhance tumor control in combination with ICI immunotherapy. Notably, this combination was effective in multiple solid tumor and lymphoma models, including those without prior ICI resistance and those in which ruxolitinib monotherapy had no effect on tumor growth. Treatment of both Cl13-infected and tumor-bearing mice with JAKis also modulated the transcriptomic and functional properties of myeloid cells from an immune suppressive state to one with immune-stimulatory potential. The ability of ruxolitinib to enhance checkpoint inhibitor efficacy was conditional on the presence of myeloid cells, and myeloid cells in ruxolitinib and ICI–treated mice showed upregulation of antigen presentation molecules, including major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II). These results demonstrate that ruxolitinib’s ability to enhance antitumor T cell responses is partly T cell extrinsic and dependent on myeloid cell modulation. We report the results of a phase I clinical trial in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who relapsed or were refractory after prior checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Ruxolitinib was administered in combination with nivolumab. The combination yielded a best overall response rate of 53% with 6/19 patients achieving a complete metabolic response to therapy. Clinical response correlated with reductions in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLRs), percentages of suppressive myeloid cells, and increases in the numbers of cytokine-producing T cells after ruxolitinib treatment. In both preclinical models and patient samples, the transcriptomic signature of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (a JAK-dependent cytokine) signaling was significantly down-regulated by ruxolitinib, suggesting that ruxolitinib may prevent suppressive programming of myeloid cells owing to excessive JAK–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling by cytokines such as G-CSF. CONCLUSION Our results support the therapeutic potential of small-molecule JAK inhibition in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in cancer. We demonstrate that JAK inhibition is not immune suppressive but rather stimulatory, suggesting that the context of JAK inhibitor usage dictates the ultimate treatment outcome. Given that the immunomodulatory properties and clinical efficacy were not exclusive to Hodgkin lymphoma, it will be important to explore the clinical potential of JAK inhibitors with ICI in solid tumors, particularly those in which suppressive myeloid cells correlate with poor response to ICI monotherapy. JAK inhibition reprograms myeloid cells to enhance checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Combination of the JAKi ruxolitinib with anti–PD-1 antibody nivolumab promotes MHC-II+ immunostimulatory and reduces suppressive myeloid cells, enhancing T cell division and function. In a clinical trial of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma relapsed or refractory following previous anti–PD-1 therapy, ruxolitinib with nivolumab achieved clinical responses that correlated with reduction in suppressive myeloid cells.

This combination therapy not only reduces immunosuppressive myeloid cells but also increases cytokine-producing T cells and rescues the function of exhausted T cells. These results suggest that JAK inhibition can reprogram myeloid cells from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory state, thereby enhancing the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Future research should explore this therapeutic strategy in solid tumors where suppressive myeloid cells hinder response to monotherapy."

These mutations promote oncogenesis by dysregulating gene expression through alterations of histone modifications. We identify aberrant DNA repair as an independent mechanism, which fosters genome instability in H3.3 mutant pHGG, and opens new therapeutic options. The two most frequent H3.3 mutations in pHGG, K27M and G34R, drive aberrant repair of replication-associated damage by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Aberrant NHEJ is mediated by the DNA repair enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase (PNKP), which shows increased association with mutant H3.3 at damaged replication forks.

Supplementation during an acute ethanol challenge with or without tributyrin, a butyrate prodrug, was delivered to C57BL/6 mice. A separate group of mice received 3 days of clindamycin prior to the acute ethanol challenge. Upon euthanasia, blood endotoxin, cecal bacteria, jejunal barrier integrity, and small intestinal lamina propria dendritic cells were assessed. HIMECs were tested for activation following exposure to ethanol ± lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sodium butyrate. Tributyrin supplementation protected a butyrate-generating microbe during ethanol and antibiotic exposure. Tributyrin rescued ethanol-induced disruption in jejunal epithelial barrier, elevated plasma endotoxin, and increased mucosal vascular addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) expression in intestinal microvascular endothelium. These protective effects of tributyrin coincided with a tolerogenic dendritic response in the intestinal lamina propria. Lastly, sodium butyrate pre- and co-treatment attenuated the direct effects of ethanol and LPS on MAdCAM-1 induction in the HIMECs from a patient with ulcerative colitis.

Here, we explored a highly responsive low temperature-inducible genetic system (LowTempGAL) in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two temperature biosensors, a heat-inducible degron and a heat-inducible protein aggregation domain, were used to regulate the GAL activator Gal4p, rendering the leaky LowTempGAL systems. Boolean-type induction was achieved by implementing a second-layer control through low-temperature-mediated repression on GAL repressor gene GAL80, but suffered delayed response to low-temperature triggers and a weak response at 30°C. Application potentials were validated for protein and small molecule production. Proteomics analysis suggested that residual Gal80p and Gal4p insufficiency caused suboptimal induction. ‘Turbo’ mechanisms were engineered through incorporating a basal Gal4p expression and a galactose-independent Gal80p-supressing Gal3p mutant (Gal3Cp). Varying Gal3Cp configurations, we deployed the LowTempGAL systems capable for a rapid stringent high-level induction upon the shift from a high temperature (37–33°C) to a low temperature (≤30°C). Overall, we present a synthetic biology procedure that leverages ‘leaky’ biosensors to deploy highly responsive Boolean-type genetic circuits.

In two distinct Env variants, we detected a transition that correlated with known Env structure rearrangements with a time constant in the hundreds of microseconds range. A previously unknown structural transition was also observed, which occurred with a time constant below 10 μs, and involved an order-to-disorder transition in the trimer apex.

Leveraging this knowledge, we propose to develop and optimize Env constructs that stabilize the protein in a prefusion closed state, potentially enhancing the efficacy of HIV vaccines."

Cells that fix CO2 with H2 require an energetic trick: They split the electron pair in H2, boosting the energy of one electron at the expense of the other to charge an ancient protein called ferredoxin with electrons. That requires enzymes and cofactors. How was ferredoxin charged before enzymes and cofactors arose? In alkaline, H2-producing hydrothermal systems, the electron-donating potential of H2 can reduce ferredoxins but requires the presence of a transition metal. We show that in water, raw iron will transfer electrons from H2 to ferredoxin, uncovering a missing link in early metabolic evolution.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '7615787', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2318969121', 'CorpusId': 268608939, 'PubMed': '38513105'}",1,"Given that the ancient reductive acetyl-CoA pathway relies on geochemically produced H2 gas to fix CO2 and requires the charging of ferredoxin with electrons, our research aims to explore the prebiotic mechanisms of ferredoxin reduction.

CML patients must take measures to prevent infections to mitigate the exacerbation of cancer cell proliferation and comorbidities. Methods: This study investigated whether vitamin C can suppress the hyperinflammatory activation of K-562 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and whether purinergic signaling (ATP and P2X7 receptor) and autophagy play a role in it. Two different doses of vitamin C (5 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL) were employed, along with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ; 100 µM), administered 2 h prior to LPS stimulation (10 ng/mL) for a duration of 22 h in K-562 cells (3 × 105 cells/mL/well). Results: Both doses of vitamin C reduced the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (5 µg/mL, p < 0.01 and 10 µg/mL, p < 0.01) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (5 µg/mL, p < 0.01 and 10 µg/mL, p < 0.01) induced by LPS. Furthermore, in LPS + CQ-stimulated cells, vitamin C at a concentration of 10 µg/mL inhibited the expression of LC3-II (p < 0.05). Conversely, both doses of vitamin C led to the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) (5 µg/mL, p < 0.01 and 10 µg/mL, p < 0.01), while only the 10 µg/mL dose of vitamin C induced the release of Klotho (10 µg/mL, p < 0.01). In addition, both doses of vitamin C reduced the accumulation of ATP (5 µg/mL, p < 0.01 and 10 µg/mL, p < 0.01) and decreased the expression of the P2X7 receptor at the mRNA level. Conclusions: Vitamin C inhibits the hyperinflammatory state induced by LPS in K-562 cells, primarily by inhibiting the ATP accumulation, P2X7 receptor expression, and autophagy signaling.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10857061', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16030383', 'CorpusId': 267355758, 'PubMed': '38337668'}",1,"Given that chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by an overproduction of white blood cells leading to severe complications, this study proposes that vitamin C could mitigate hyperinflammatory responses in CML cells.

Therefore, the study aimed to compare eating habits, body composition and densitometric parameters between subjects with normal cognitive function (NCF) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 95 subjects with NCF (74% of women) and 95 individuals with MCI (77% of women) aged 50–70 years were studied. Densitometric parameters were evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry methods. Eating habits were assessed using the food frequency questionnaire and 3-day diary records, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) intake was calculated. Significant differences between groups were detected for the %fat in the right arm (NCF vs. MCI: 38.4 (30.4–46.8) vs. 43.5 (35.5–49.2)%, p = 0.0407). Moreover, the MCI group had a significantly lower intake of calcium (p = 0.0010), phosphor (p = 0.0411), vitamins B2 (p = 0.0138) and B12 (p = 0.0024) compared to the NCF group, with both groups also differing in the frequency of butter (p = 0.0191) and fermented milk beverages (p = 0.0398) intake. Analysis restricted to women showed significant differences between groups in right arm %fat, VAT mass, calcium, vitamins B2, B12, butter and fermented milk products intake, while in men, differences were detected in the intake of calcium, iodine, vitamin B1, water and AGEs.

Phage-derived elements are frequently strain specific in their killing activity, although there is limited evidence that this specificity drives bacterial population dynamics. Here, we identified intact phage and their derived elements in a metapopulation of wild plant–associated Pseudomonas genomes. We discovered that the most abundant viral cluster encodes a phage remnant resembling a phage tail called a tailocin, which bacteria have co-opted to kill bacterial competitors. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants that target the variable polysaccharides in the outer membrane of co-occurring pathogenic Pseudomonas strains. Analysis of herbarium samples from the past 170 years revealed that the same tailocin and bacterial receptor variants have persisted in Pseudomonas populations. These results suggest that tailocin genetic diversity can be mined to develop targeted “tailocin cocktails” for microbial control. Editor’s summary Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are abundant, but we do not understand much about how they interact with bacteria in wild populations. Backman et al. investigated wild-collected herbarium samples of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, infected with the bacterium Pseudomonas viridiflava. Comparative genomics between modern and historical Pseudomonas strains revealed a viral gene cluster encoding a phage tail fiber protein called a tailocin, which has been co-opted as a toxic element by the bacteria to ward off competitors. Purified tailocin killed a selection of non-kin but closely related bacteria while being less potent or not at all potent against other plant-associated bacteria. The dominant tailocin among the plant specimens examined has persisted largely unchanged for more than 177 years. —Caroline Ash INTRODUCTION Understanding the factors influencing plant pathogen spread is vital for developing disease prevention strategies. Bacterial pathogens must overcome plant immunity, compete with microbes, and resist bacteriophages to colonize plants. Host genetics affect pathogen suppression, but the role of the surrounding microbiota remains unclear. Bacteriophage (phage), viruses of bacteria, and phage-derived elements are widespread entities that selectively kill bacteria. These elements, repurposed from phage ancestors, target co-occurring bacterial strains, potentially shaping microbial communities. Despite their prevalence, their impact on plant microbiota and pathogen spread remains largely unknown. RATIONALE Our previous work revealed that wild populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, unlike agricultural and clinical pathogen outbreaks, are colonized by genetically diverse Pseudomonas populations without dominant strains. Infections with Pseudomonas viridiflava comprised multiple co-occurring strains even within single plants. What prevents single pathogenic lineages from spreading? Host immune diversity likely contributes to pathogen diversity, but the plant microbiome may also play a role. Given the common occurrence of phage and phage-derived elements and their strain-specific killing activity in Pseudomonas populations, we hypothesized that differences in sensitivity to phage components could suppress specific strains. RESULTS We discovered an abundant viral cluster that is conserved across pathogenic strains. This cluster does not encode an intact phage but rather encodes a tailocin, a phage-derived element that bacteria use to kill bacterial competitors. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants, which target variable polysaccharides in the outer membrane of co-occurring pathogens. Analysis of historic herbarium samples revealed that the same tailocin and outer membrane variants have persisted in the Pseudomonas populations for at least two centuries, suggesting the continued use of a defined set of tailocin haplotypes and receptors. Our results support a model in which the tailocin and outer membranes of co-occurring Pseudomonas strains are evolving in concert in wild A. thaliana populations. The divergent tailocin and outer membrane haplotypes have been maintained across time and space. CONCLUSION The presence of a limited set of tailocin haplotypes in the metapopulation could reflect a limited panel of resistance mechanisms. Our findings provide a roadmap for identifying tailocin specificities to different strains and the possibility of determining the mechanism of this specificity. Tailocin therapy, akin to phage therapy, holds promise as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. Initial studies demonstrate its efficacy in suppressing pathogens in various plant and animal models. However, as with any antimicrobial treatment, resistance may arise. Our results suggest that “tailocin cocktails” leveraging the genetic diversity of pathogens could mitigate resistance by targeting the metapopulation concurrently. Pathogenic bacterial competitors on a leaf surface deploy tailocins as antagonistic agents. Tailocins are elements derived from bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) that have been repurposed to selectively target and kill strains of neighboring bacteria. The deployment of a diverse yet limited set of tailocins among pathogenic bacteria maintains their diversity over evolutionary timescales and shapes the coevolution of tailocins and their receptors in the outer membrane of targeted bacterial cells.

They are both converted to methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), which metabolize homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, respectively. Here, we compare the kinetics of uptake and the intracellular transformations of radiolabeled CNCbl vs. HOCbl in HeLa cells. More HOCbl was accumulated over 4–48 h, but further extrapolation indicated similar uptake (>90%) for both vitamin forms. The initially synthesized coenzyme was MeCbl, which noticeably exceeded AdoCbl during 48 h. Yet, the synthesis of AdoCbl accelerated, and the predicted final levels of Cbls were MeCbl ≈ AdoCbl ≈ 40% and HOCbl ≈ 20%. The designed kinetic model revealed the same patterns of the uptake and turnover for CNCbl and HOCbl, apart from two steps. First, the “activating” intracellular processing of the internalized HOCbl was six-fold faster. Second, the detachment rates from the cell surface (when the “excessive” Cbl-molecules were refluxed into the external medium) related as 4:1 for CNCbl vs. HOCbl. This gave a two-fold faster cellular accumulation and processing of HOCbl vs. CNCbl. In medical terms, our data suggest (i) an earlier response to the treatment of Cbl-deficiency with HOCbl, and (ii) the manifestation of a successful treatment initially as a decrease in homocysteine.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10857013', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16030378', 'CorpusId': 267351379, 'PubMed': '38337663'}",1,"Given that cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) and aquo/hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl) are commonly used forms of vitamin B12 for supplementation, this study compares their uptake kinetics and intracellular transformations in HeLa cells to understand their efficacy in treating B12 deficiency.

These findings suggest that HOCbl may provide a quicker therapeutic response in treating Cbl-deficiency, initially indicated by a reduction in homocysteine levels."

Lysine succinylation (Ksucc) plays a vital role in cell energy metabolism in various cancers. However, whether succinylation can be catalyzed by acetyltransferase p300 remains unclear. In this study, we unveiled that p300 is a “writer” for succinylation, and p300-mediated Ksucc promotes cell glycometabolism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically, our succinylome data revealed that EP300 deficiency leads to the systemic reduction of Ksucc, and 79.55% of the p300-succinylated proteins were found in the cytoplasm, which were primarily enriched in the carbohydrate metabolism process. Interestingly, deleting EP300 led to a notable decrease in Ksucc levels on several glycolytic enzymes, especially Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (PGK1). Mutation of the succinylated site of PGK1 notably hindered cell glycolysis and lactic acid excretion. Metabolomics in vivo indicated that p300-caused metabolic reprogramming was mainly attributed to the altered carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, 89.35% of LUAD patients exhibited cytoplasmic localization of p300, with higher levels in tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues. High levels of p300 correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis of LUAD patients.

These values may affect emotion processing (EP): the recognition, interpretation, expression and response to bodily sensations, translated as emotions. These varying values may contribute to distinct emotional experiences, impacting physical and psychological symptoms in breast cancer (BC) survivors. Methods This cross-sectional study investigated how EP including acceptance, expression (avoidance and approach coping), and awareness, may mediate the relationship between conservation values and symptoms of pain, fatigue, and depression among Arab (n = 62) and Jewish (n = 179) women BC survivors in Israel. Conservation values include tradition, conformity, and security. Results Depression and fatigue were negatively correlated with acceptance of emotions, and positively correlated with avoidance and conservation levels. Emotion processing mediated the relationship between conservation and fatigue and depression. Arab women reported higher levels of various values, emotional acceptance, pain, fatigue, and depression symptoms compared to Jewish women. Conservation was higher in Arab women and correlated with both approach and avoidance coping which was not the case in Jewish women. Avoidance coping had a positive relationship with fatigue in the Jewish, but not the Arab women. Similarly, approach coping was negatively related to depression in Jewish, but not in Arab women.

Dendrobium chrysotoxum, D. huoshanense, and D. nobile are valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties. However, the specific functions of the WOX gene family in Dendrobium species are not well understood. In our study, a total of 30 WOX genes were present in the genomes of the three Dendrobium species (nine DchWOXs, 11 DhuWOXs, and ten DnoWOXs). These 30 WOXs were clustered into ancient clades, intermediate clades, and WUS/modern clades. All 30 WOXs contained a conserved homeodomain, and the conserved motifs and gene structures were similar among WOXs belonging to the same branch. D. chrysotoxum and D. huoshanense had one pair of fragment duplication genes and one pair of tandem duplication genes, respectively; D. nobile had two pairs of fragment duplication genes. The cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) in the WOX promoter region were mainly enriched in the light response, stress response, and plant growth and development regulation. The expression pattern and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the WOXs were involved in regulating the floral organ development of D. chrysotoxum. Among them, the high expression of DchWOX3 suggests that it might be involved in controlling lip development, whereas DchWOX5 might be involved in controlling ovary development.

However, curcumin faces challenges stemming from its unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile. To address this issue, synthetic curcumin derivatives aimed at enhancing the biological efficacy of curcumin have previously been developed. In silico modelling techniques have gained significant recognition in screening synthetic compounds as drug candidates. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of three synthetic derivatives of curcumin. This evaluation was conducted in comparison to curcumin, with a specific emphasis on examining their impact on adipogenesis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism as potential therapeutic targets of obesity mechanisms. In this study, predictive toxicity screening confirmed the safety of curcumin, with the curcumin derivatives demonstrating a safe profile based on their LD50 values. The synthetic curcumin derivative 1A8 exhibited inactivity across all selected toxicity endpoints. Furthermore, these compounds were deemed viable candidate drugs as they adhered to Lipinski’s rules and exhibited favorable metabolic profiles. Molecular docking studies revealed that both curcumin and its synthetic derivatives exhibited favorable binding scores, whilst molecular dynamic simulations showed stable binding with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), csyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) proteins. The binding free energy calculations indicated that curcumin displayed potential as a strong regulator of PPARγ (−60.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol) and FAS (−37.9 ± 0.3 kcal/mol), whereas 1A8 demonstrated robust binding affinity with COX2 (−64.9 ± 0.2 kcal/mol).

In this paper, we develop a multifunctional study based on polyhedral oligomeric sesquisiloxane (POSS) that exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect through mild photothermal and chemotherapy treatments (POSS-SQ-DOX). The nanoplatform utilizes SQ-N as a photothermal agent (PTA) for mild photothermal, while doxorubicin (DOX) serves as the chemotherapeutic drug for chemotherapy. By incorporating POSS into the nanoplatform, we successfully prevent the aggregation of SQ-N in aqueous solutions, thus maintaining its excellent photothermal properties both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the introduction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) significantly enhances cell permeability, which contributes to the remarkable therapeutic effect of POSS-SQ-DOX NPs. Our studies on the photothermal properties of POSS-SQ-DOX NPs demonstrate their high photothermal conversion efficiency (62.3%) and stability, confirming their suitability for use in mild photothermal therapy. A combination index value (CI = 0.72) verified the presence of a synergistic effect between these two treatments, indicating that POSS-SQ-DOX NPs exhibited significantly higher cell mortality (74.7%) and tumor inhibition rate (72.7%) compared to single chemotherapy and mild photothermal therapy.

Drugs that enhance DA and NE neurotransmission in the brain by blocking their transporters or receptors are the current therapeutic strategies. Of late, the emerging results point out the serotonergic (5-HT) system, which indirectly modulates the DA activity in reducing the core symptoms of ADHD. On this basis, second-generation antipsychotics, which utilize 5-HT receptors, were prescribed to children with ADHD. However, it is not clear how serotonergic receptors modulate the DA activity to minimize the symptoms of ADHD. The present study investigates the efficacy of serotonergic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor manipulation in tackling the core symptoms of ADHD and how it affects the DA neuroreceptors in the brain regions involved in ADHD. Fifteen-day-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) received 5-HT1A agonist (ipsapirone) or 5-HT2A antagonist (MDL 100907) (i.p.) or alpha-2 agonist (GFC) from postnatal days 15 to 42 along with age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) (n = 8 in each group). ADHD-like behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests during postnatal days 44 to 65. After the behavioral tests, rat brains were processed to estimate the density of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, DA-D1, and DA-D2 neuroreceptors in the prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the substantia nigra. All three neuroreceptor manipulations were able to minimize the core symptoms of ADHD in SHRs. The positive effect was mainly associated with the upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors in all three areas investigated, while 5-HT1A was in the prefrontal cortex and the substantia nigra. Further, the DA-D1 receptor expression was downregulated by all three neuroreceptor manipulations except for alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists in the striatum and 5-HT2A antagonists in the substantia nigra. The DA-D2 expression was upregulated in the striatum while downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and the substantia nigra. In this animal model study, the 5-HT1A agonist or 5-HT2A antagonist monotherapies were able to curtail the ADHD symptoms by differential expression of DA receptors in different regions of the brain.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10888658', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042300', 'CorpusId': 267712970, 'PubMed': '38396978'}",1,"Given that the core symptoms of ADHD are linked to hypofunction of the brain’s adrenergic and dopamine systems, with current therapies focusing on enhancing DA and NE neurotransmission, emerging evidence suggests that the serotonergic (5-HT) system may also play a significant role in modulating DA activity to alleviate ADHD symptoms. This study investigates how serotonergic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor manipulation affects DA neuroreceptors and ADHD-like behaviors in male spontaneously hypertensive rats. Results indicate that manipulating 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, as well as alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, can reduce ADHD symptoms, primarily through upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors across several brain regions and modulation of DA-D1 and DA-D2 receptor expression. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for targeting serotonergic pathways in ADHD treatment."

There are no approved therapeutics for MeV. Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral fusion are one potential therapeutic approach but have not yet been structurally characterized or advanced to clinical use. We present cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of prefusion F alone [2.1-angstrom (Å) resolution], F complexed with a fusion-inhibitory peptide (2.3-Å resolution), F complexed with the neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 (2.6-Å resolution), and an additional structure of postfusion F (2.7-Å resolution). In vitro assays and examination of additional EM classes show that mAb 77 binds prefusion F, arrests F in an intermediate state, and prevents transition to the postfusion conformation. These structures shed light on antibody-mediated neutralization that involves arrest of fusion proteins in an intermediate state. Editor’s summary The transcription factor GATA3 controls the differentiation of naïve innate lymphoid cells and T cells into their type 2 effector subtypes, innate lymphoid 2 cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 cells (TH2s), respectively, during immune responses. Szeto et al. found that another transcription factor, Mef2d, augmented the expression of GATA3 and the type-2 cytokine interleukin-13. The authors generated a mouse model that resulted in deletion of Mef2d in mature ILC2s specifically. Using it alongside established gene-knockout systems, the authors determined that Mef2d promotes the function of ILC2 and TH2 cells during lung inflammation. Mef2d controls gene expression associated with type 2 responses by inhibiting the expression of Regnase-1, which controls mRNA abundance, and by interacting with another transcription factor, nuclear factor of Measles outbreaks are on the rise in the US and other countries due to falling vaccination rates. There are currently no available specific antiviral treatments and only limited structural information about neutralizing antibodies that might be useful as therapeutics. Zyla et al. determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the measles virus fusion protein in complex with an antibody or an engineered peptide, both of which can block fusion (see the Perspective by Aguilar). The authors identified multiple conformational states of the fusion protein and inferred that the antibody can trap an intermediate in the refolding process, thus halting fusion. Therefore, in addition to visualizing an important epitope that may be a therapeutic target, these structures provide mechanistic information about the viral fusion process in this system. —Michael A. Funk INTRODUCTION Declining vaccination rates have resulted in a global resurgence of measles virus (MeV) and a clear need for effective treatments for those who cannot or have not yet been vaccinated or those in whom vaccines do not elicit neutralizing immunity. A promising approach involves neutralizing antibodies directed at the viral fusion protein F, but no such neutralizing antibodies are yet structurally characterized or approved. RATIONALE This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 and assess its potential as a therapeutic for MeV infection. RESULTS We find that mAb 77 potently neutralizes MeV infection in vitro and significantly reduces replication and viral loads in vivo in the cotton rat model. A mechanistic assay revealed that mAb 77 effectively prevents complete membrane fusion, but it does so without blocking F activation, the initiation of fusion, or the formation of the extended intermediate. To understand the mechanism of neutralization of mAb 77, we engineered a stabilized F ectodomain (FECTO) with two naturally occurring point mutations identified in cases of MeV encephalitis. These two point mutations allowed expression of F in the prefusion conformation without exogenous trimerization domains while still permitting later folding of this F into its postfusion state. A 2.11-Å-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of MeV FECTO in its prefusion state demonstrated that the two stabilizing mutations did not affect the overall structure, and a further structure of the postfusion F at 2.7-Å-resolution provided the endpoint structure needed to model intermediates in the refolding pathway. A third cryo-EM structure, of FECTO in complex with Fab 77 (2.6-Å resolution), revealed the antibody epitope. mAb 77 simultaneously bridges domains I and II, the N-terminal part of F2, and the linker in between domain II and C-terminal heptad repeat, and on the edge of the epitope also recognizes the fusion peptide. This conformational epitope is only present in the prefusion form of F. To reconcile this prefusion-bound structure with mechanistic information that mAb 77 neutralized at a post-triggering state, we sought to understand intermediates in refolding and the stage at which mAb 77 blocked the fusion process. A deeper analysis of the cryo-EM dataset of the FECTO–Fab 77 complex uncovered subpopulations of particles in a series of two-dimensional (2D) classes that illustrated snapshots in refolding (triggering, extended intermediate, trimer separation) and also allowed visualization of a trimeric, refolding-intermediate state arrested by bound Fab 77. A fourth structure, of this Fab 77–stabilized F fragment, was resolved to 3.6-Å resolution, revealing that the antibody still binds domains I and II and part of the F2 chain in their prefusion arrangement and that anchoring of these regions together arrests the process of refolding at this intermediate stage. CONCLUSION Our study reveals in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection by mAb 77, as well as the cryo-EM structure of mAb 77 in complex with MeV F and its mechanism of action, which provides information that is important for potential therapeutic use against MeV infection. We showed that mAb 77 specifically recognizes MeV F in the prefusion conformation and allows initial F activation and refolding but also that it interrupts the refolding process to prevent conformational changes required for membrane fusion and viral entry. These findings suggest a model for understanding not only antibody neutralization of MeV but also other viruses for which antibodies are thought to interrupt fusion but for which structures are not yet available.

The annotation below is color coded to the domains shown on the right. (Bottom) Proposed mechanism of mAb 77 action. (1) mAb77 recognizes FECTO in the prefusion conformation but (2) allows F to initiate refolding to the extended refolding intermediate connecting viral (VM) and host (HM) membranes. (3) After triggering, mAb 77–bound F monomers separate from each other. (4) Finally, separation results in a single F protomer fragment arrested from further rearrangement by mAb-mediated anchoring together of domains I and II and the F2 chain (not shown), maintaining most of the prefusion epitope.",2024,Science,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adm8693', 'CorpusId': 270765140, 'PubMed': '38935733'}",1,"Given that measles virus (MeV) remains a significant public health issue due to decreasing vaccination rates and the absence of approved therapeutics, the research proposes exploring the potential of neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral fusion protein F as a treatment option.

The findings demonstrate that mAb 77 effectively neutralizes MeV by binding to the prefusion conformation of the F protein, thereby arresting the protein in an intermediate state and preventing the transition to the postfusion conformation necessary for viral entry. This mechanistic insight into antibody-mediated neutralization could guide the development of therapeutic strategies not only against MeV but also other viral infections requiring similar intervention."

A well-established pathogenic hallmark of ALS is mitochondrial failure, leading to bioenergetic deficits. So far, pharmacological interventions for the disease have proven ineffective. Trimetazidine (TMZ) is described as a metabolic modulator acting on different cellular pathways. Its efficacy in enhancing muscular and cardiovascular performance has been widely described, although its molecular target remains elusive. We addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying TMZ action on neuronal experimental paradigms. To this aim, we treated murine SOD1G93A-model-derived primary cultures of cortical and spinal enriched motor neurons, as well as a murine motor-neuron-like cell line overexpressing SOD1G93A, with TMZ. We first characterized the bioenergetic profile of the cell cultures, demonstrating significant mitochondrial dysfunction that is reversed by acute TMZ treatments. We then investigated the effect of TMZ in promoting autophagy processes and its impact on mitochondrial morphology. Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TMZ in terms of the mitochondrial functionality of ALS-rpatient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In summary, our results emphasize the concept that targeting mitochondrial dysfunction may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ALS. The findings demonstrate that TMZ enhances mitochondrial performance in motor neuron cells by activating autophagy processes, particularly mitophagy. Although further investigations are needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathways involved, these results hold critical implications for the development of more effective and specific derivatives of TMZ for ALS treatment.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970050', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063251', 'CorpusId': 268443081, 'PubMed': '38542223'}",1,"Given that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is typified by motor neuron loss and mitochondrial failure, our research aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS treatment.

However, there is currently limited research on the feedback regulation of ABF1 in ABA signaling. This study delves into the function of BcABF1 in Pakchoi. We observed a marked increase in BcABF1 expression in leaves upon ABA induction. The overexpression of BcABF1 not only spurred Arabidopsis growth but also augmented the levels of endogenous IAA. Furthermore, BcABF1 overexpression in Arabidopsis significantly decreased leaf water loss and enhanced the expression of genes associated with drought tolerance in the ABA pathway. Intriguingly, we found that BcABF1 can directly activate BcPYL4 expression, a critical receptor in the ABA pathway. Similar to BcABF1, the overexpression of BcPYL4 in Arabidopsis also reduces leaf water loss and promotes the expression of drought and other ABA-responsive genes. Finally, our findings suggested a novel feedback regulation mechanism within the ABA signaling pathway, wherein BcABF1 positively amplifies the ABA signal by directly binding to and activating the BcPYL4 promoter.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11011251', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073877', 'CorpusId': 268850333, 'PubMed': '38612692'}",1,"Given that abscisic acid-responsive element-binding factor 1 (ABF1) plays a crucial role in the ABA signal transduction process by regulating ABA-responsive genes and influencing plant responses to abiotic stress, this research explores the feedback regulation of ABF1, particularly in Pakchoi.

Although inflammation is critical to COPD pathogenesis, the cellular and molecular basis underlying smoking-induced lung inflammation and pathology remains unclear. Using murine smoke models and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show that smoking establishes a self-amplifying inflammatory loop characterized by an influx of molecularly heterogeneous neutrophil subsets and excessive recruitment of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAM). In contrast to tissue-resident AM, MoAM are absent in homeostasis and characterized by a pro-inflammatory gene signature. Moreover, MoAM represent 46% of AM in emphysematous mice and express markers causally linked to emphysema. We also demonstrate the presence of pro-inflammatory and tissue remodeling associated MoAM orthologs in humans that are significantly increased in emphysematous COPD patients. Inhibition of the IRAK4 kinase depletes a rare inflammatory neutrophil subset, diminishes MoAM recruitment, and alleviates inflammation in the lung of cigarette smoke-exposed mice. This study extends our understanding of the molecular signaling circuits and cellular dynamics in smoking-induced lung inflammation and pathology, highlights the functional consequence of monocyte and neutrophil recruitment, identifies MoAM as key drivers of the inflammatory process, and supports their contribution to pathological tissue remodeling.",2024,Frontiers in Immunology,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10859862', 'DOI': '10.3389/fimmu.2024.1325090', 'CorpusId': 267353667, 'PubMed': '38348034'}",1,"Given that smoking-induced chronic lung inflammation and tissue remodeling significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), our research aims to investigate the cellular and molecular underpinnings of this process.

Its modulatory effect on painful sensation is often seen as a systemic function affecting the whole body similarly. However, recent animal data suggest some kind of somatotopy in the PAG. This would make the PAG capable of dermatome-specific analgesic function. We electrically stimulated the three peripheral dermatomes of the trigemino-cervical complex and the greater occipital nerve in 61 humans during optimized brainstem functional magnetic resonance imaging. We provide evidence for a fine-grained and highly specific somatotopic representation of nociceptive input in the PAG in humans and a functional connectivity between the individual representations of the peripheral nerves in the PAG and the brainstem nuclei of these nerves.

Previous studies have reported that two MADS-box genes, SlMBP21 and SlMADS1, play important regulatory roles in the sepal development of tomato, respectively. However, the functional relationships between these two genes are still unknown. In order to investigate this, we simultaneously studied these two genes in tomato. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they were classified into the same branch of the SEPALLATA (SEP) clade. qRT-PCR displayed that both SlMBP21 and SlMADS1 transcripts are preferentially accumulated in sepals, and are increased with flower development. During sepal development, SlMBP21 is increased but SlMADS1 is decreased. Using the RNAi, tomato plants with reduced SlMBP21 mRNA generated enlarged and fused sepals, while simultaneous inhibition of SlMBP21 and SlMADS1 led to larger (longer and wider) and fused sepals than that in SlMBP21-RNAi lines. qRT-PCR results exhibited that the transcripts of genes relating to sepal development, ethylene, auxin and cell expansion were dramatically changed in SlMBP21-RNAi sepals, especially in SlMBP21-SlMADS1-RNAi sepals. Yeast two-hybrid assay displayed that SlMBP21 can interact with SlMBP21, SlAP2a, TAGL1 and RIN, and SlMADS1 can interact with SlAP2a and RIN, respectively.

Immunophenotyping of leukocytes isolated from CRC-bearing BALB/c mice or healthy controls, such as CD19+ B cells, CD11+ myeloid cells, and CD3+ T cells, was carried out using fluorochrome-labeled lectins. The binding of six lectins to white blood cells, such as galectin-1 (Gal1), siglec-1 (Sig1), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL), Phytolacca americana lectin (PWM), and galectin-3 (Gal3), was assayed.

In this study, we investigated the expression of CDC23 in pigs, and the results indicated that CDC23 is widely expressed in various tissues and organs. In vitro cell experiments have demonstrated that CDC23 promotes the proliferation of myoblasts, as well as significantly positively regulating the differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed a significant downregulation of the cell cycle pathway during the differentiation process of skeletal muscle satellite cells. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network showed a high degree of interaction between genes related to the cell cycle pathway and CDC23. Subsequently, in differentiated myocytes induced after overexpression of CDC23, the level of CDC23 exhibited a significant negative correlation with the expression of key factors in the cell cycle pathway, suggesting that CDC23 may be involved in the inhibition of the cell cycle signaling pathway in order to promote the differentiation process. In summary, we preliminarily determined the function of CDC23 with the aim of providing new insights into molecular regulation during porcine skeletal muscle development.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11011816', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073664', 'CorpusId': 268700742, 'PubMed': '38612477'}",1,"Given that CDC23 is a key component in the APC/C complex involved in mitosis regulation, this study proposes that CDC23 also plays a crucial role in muscle production in pigs.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicates a downregulation of the cell cycle pathway during muscle cell differentiation, and the protein-protein interaction network highlights significant interactions between CDC23 and cell cycle-related genes. Overexpression of CDC23 in differentiated myocytes correlates negatively with key cell cycle factors, suggesting CDC23's involvement in inhibiting the cell cycle to facilitate muscle cell differentiation.

Systemic tacrolimus (FK506) administration has been shown to hasten recovery and improve functional outcomes after PNI repair. Unfortunately, high systemic levels of FK506 can result in adverse side effects. The localized administration of FK506 could provide the neuroregenerative benefits of FK506 while avoiding systemic, off-target side effects. This study investigates the utility of a novel FK506-impregnated polyester urethane urea (PEUU) nerve wrap to treat PNI in a previously validated rat infraorbital nerve (ION) transection and repair model. ION function was assessed by microelectrode recordings of trigeminal ganglion cells responding to controlled vibrissae deflections in ION-transected and -repaired animals, with and without the nerve wrap. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) having 1 ms bins were constructed from spike times of individual single units. Responses to stimulus onsets (ON responses) were calculated during a 20 ms period beginning 1 ms after deflection onset; this epoch captures the initial, transient phase of the whisker-evoked response. Compared to no-wrap controls, rats with PEUU-FK506 wraps functionally recovered earlier, displaying larger response magnitudes. With nerve wrap treatment, FK506 blood levels up to six weeks were measured nearly at the limit of quantification (LOQ ≥ 2.0 ng/mL); whereas the drug concentrations within the ION and muscle were much higher, demonstrating the local delivery of FK506 to treat PNI. An immunohistological assessment of ION showed increased myelin expression for animals assigned to neurorrhaphy with PEUU-FK506 treatment compared to untreated or systemic-FK506-treated animals, suggesting that improved PNI outcomes using PEUU-FK506 is mediated by the modulation of Schwann cell activity.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10815243', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25020847', 'CorpusId': 266936620, 'PubMed': '38255920'}",1,"Given that peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) often result in significant and lasting sensory and motor deficits, the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance nerve regeneration while minimizing adverse systemic effects is crucial.

The findings indicate that rats treated with the PEUU-FK506 nerve wrap exhibit earlier functional recovery and increased response magnitudes compared to controls, with FK506 levels remaining low systemically but high locally in the nerve and muscle tissues. Furthermore, immunohistological analysis revealed enhanced myelin expression, suggesting that the neuroregenerative benefits of the PEUU-FK506 treatment are likely mediated by the activation of Schwann cells."

We studied the role of the VRK1 chromatin kinase in the response to oxidative stress. which alters the nuclear pattern of histone epigenetic modifications and phosphoproteome pathways. The early effect of oxidative stress on chromatin was studied by determining the levels of 8-oxoG lesions and the alteration of the epigenetic modification of histones. Oxidative stress caused an accumulation of 8-oxoG DNA lesions that were increased by VRK1 depletion, causing a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks detected by labeling free 3′-DNA ends. In addition, oxidative stress altered the pattern of chromatin epigenetic marks and the nuclear phosphoproteome pathways that were impaired by VRK1 depletion. Oxidative stress induced the acetylation of H4K16ac and H3K9 and the loss of H3K4me3. The depletion of VRK1 altered all these modifications induced by oxidative stress and resulted in losses of H4K16ac and H3K9ac and increases in the H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 levels. All these changes were induced by the oxidative stress in the epigenetic pattern of histones and impaired by VRK1 depletion, indicating that VRK1 plays a major role in the functional reorganization of chromatin in the response to oxidative stress. The analysis of the nuclear phosphoproteome in response to oxidative stress detected an enrichment of the phosphorylated proteins associated with the chromosome organization and chromatin remodeling pathways, which were significantly decreased by VRK1 depletion. VRK1 depletion alters the histone epigenetic pattern and nuclear phosphoproteome pathways in response to oxidative stress.

Moreover, VRK1 appears to be critical in regulating the phosphorylation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. These insights highlight the potential of targeting post-translational modifications facilitated by VRK1 for developing synthetic lethality strategies in cancer therapy."

Most recently, mounting clinical evidence suggests an anti-cancer effect via CMV-induced T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, the data were mostly obtained from single-center studies and in vitro experiments. Broad geographic coverage is required to offer a global perspective. Our study examined the correlation between country-specific CMV seroprevalence (across 73 countries) and the age-standardized incidence rate (of 34 invasive tumors). The populations studied were stratified according to decadal age periods as the immunologic effects of CMV seropositivity may depend upon age at initial infection. The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (IARC WHO) database was used. The multivariate linear regression analysis revealed a worldwide inverse correlation between CMV seroprevalence and the incidences of 62.8% tumors. Notably, this inverse link persists for all cancers combined (Spearman’s ρ = −0.732, p < 0.001; β = −0.482, p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.737). An antithetical and significant correlation was also observed in particular age groups for the vast majority of tumors. Our results corroborate the conclusions of previous studies and indicate that this oncopreventive phenomenon holds true on a global scale. It applies to a wide spectrum of cancer histologies, additionally supporting the idea of a common underlying mechanism—CMV-stimulated T cell tumor targeting. Although these results further advance the notion of CMV-based therapies, in-depth investigation of host–virus interactions is still warranted.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11012084', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073741', 'CorpusId': 268735938, 'PubMed': '38612552'}",1,"Given that human cytomegalovirus (CMV) may have an anti-cancer effect through T cell-mediated tumor destruction, this study explores the global correlation between CMV seroprevalence and cancer incidence across 73 countries.

These mutations play a key role in the development and progression of lymphoproliferative tumors by increasing the Notch signaling and, consequently, promoting cell proliferation, survival, migration, and suppressing apoptosis. There is currently no specific treatment available for cancers caused by NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations. However, several NOTCH1 inhibitors are in development. Among these, inhibition of the Sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) showed a greater effect in NOTCH1-mutated tumors compared to the wild-type ones. One example is CAD204520, a benzimidazole derivative active in T-ALL cells harboring NOTCH1 mutations. In this study, we preclinically assessed the effect of CAD204520 in CLL and MCL models and showed that NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations sensitize cells to the anti-leukemic activity mediated by CAD204520. Additionally, we tested the potential of CAD204520 in combination with the current first-line treatment of CLL, venetoclax, and ibrutinib. CAD204520 enhanced the synergistic effect of this treatment regimen only in samples harboring the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations, thus supporting a role for Notch inhibition in these tumors. In summary, our work provides strong support for the development of CAD204520 as a novel therapeutic approach also in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders carrying NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations, emerging as a promising molecule for combination treatment in this aggressive subset of patients.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10815907', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25020766', 'CorpusId': 266884783, 'PubMed': '38255842'}",1,"Given that NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations are implicated in various hematopoietic malignancies and contribute to tumor progression through enhanced Notch signaling, our research proposes investigating the efficacy of CAD204520, a SERCA inhibitor, in treating these cancers.

Current treatment approaches thus require modulation, with attention shifting towards liberating the stalled efficacy of immunotherapies. Select chemotherapy drugs which possess inherent immune-modifying behaviors could revitalize immune activity against pancreatic tumors and potentiate immunotherapeutic success. In this study, we characterized the influence of gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, on tumor antigen presentation by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I). Gemcitabine increased pancreatic cancer cells’ HLA-I mRNA transcripts, total protein, surface expression, and surface stability. Temperature-dependent assay results indicated that the increased HLA-I stability may be due to reduced binding of low affinity peptides. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed changes in the HLA-I-presented peptide pool post-treatment, and computational predictions suggested improved affinity and immunogenicity of peptides displayed solely by gemcitabine-treated cells. Most of the gemcitabine-exclusive peptides were derived from unique source proteins, with a notable overrepresentation of translation-related proteins. Gemcitabine also increased expression of select immunoproteasome subunits, providing a plausible mechanism for its modulation of the HLA-I-bound peptidome.

It is initiated by the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA catalysed by evolutionarily conserved Spo11, together with additional protein partners. Difficulties in purifying the Spo11 protein have limited the characterization of its biochemical properties and of its interactions with other DSB proteins. In this study, we have purified fragments of Spo11 and show for the first time that Spo11 can physically interact with Mre11 and modulates its DNA binding, bridging, and nuclease activities. The interaction of Mre11 with Spo11 requires its far C-terminal region, which is in line with the severe meiotic phenotypes of various mre11 mutations located at the C-terminus. Moreover, calibrated ChIP for Mre11 shows that Spo11 promotes Mre11 recruitment to chromatin, independent of DSB formation. A mutant deficient in Spo11 interaction severely reduces the association of Mre11 with meiotic chromatin. Consistent with the reduction of Mre11 foci in this mutant, it strongly impedes DSB formation, leading to spore death. Our data provide evidence that physical interaction between Spo11 and Mre11, together with end-bridging, promote normal recruitment of Mre11 to hotspots and DSB formation.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11077076', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae111', 'CorpusId': 267929335, 'PubMed': '38407383'}",1,"Given that meiotic recombination is essential for both chromosome segregation and genetic diversity, this study investigates the biochemical interactions between the Spo11 protein and Mre11, a protein complex involved in double-strand break (DSB) formation.

The study highlights that Spo11 is crucial for recruiting Mre11 to chromatin, independent of DSB formation, and that a deficiency in Spo11-Mre11 interaction leads to reduced Mre11 association with chromatin, impaired DSB formation, and consequent spore death. These findings suggest that the physical interaction between Spo11 and Mre11 is vital for proper meiotic DSB formation and chromosomal integrity."

In metazoans, many of the critical hypoxia responses are mediated by the evolutionarily conserved hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). The stability and activity of HIF complexes are strictly regulated. In the model organism C. elegans, HIF-1 stability and activity are negatively regulated by VHL-1, EGL-9, RHY-1 and SWAN-1. Importantly, C. elegans mutants carrying strong loss-of-function mutations in these genes are viable, and this provides opportunities to interrogate the molecular consequences of persistent HIF-1 over-activation. We find that the genome-wide gene expression patterns are compellingly similar in these mutants, supporting models in which RHY-1, VHL-1 and EGL-9 function in common pathway(s) to regulate HIF-1 activity. These studies illuminate the diversified biological roles played by HIF-1, including metabolism and stress response.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and heart failure (HF) are strongly linked to the ageing phenotype and are the leading cause of death. As the human heart is considered as an organ with low regenerative capacity, treatments targeting the rejuvenation of human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) are of great interest. In this study, the beneficial effects of human blood serum on proliferation and senescence of hCSCs have been investigated at the molecular level. We show the induction of a proliferation-related gene expression response by human blood serum at the mRNA level. The concurrent differential expression of the TGFβ target and inhibitor genes indicates the participation of TGFβ signalling in this context. Surprisingly, the application of TGFβ1 as well as the inhibition of TGFβ type I and type II receptor (TGFβRI/II) signalling strongly increased the proliferation of hCSCs. Likewise, both human blood serum and TGFβ1 reduced the senescence in hCSCs. The protective effect of serum on senescence in hCSCs was enhanced by simultaneous TGFβRI/II inhibition. These results strongly indicate a dual role of TGFβ signalling in terms of the serum-mediated effects on hCSCs. Further analysis via RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed the participation of Ras-inactivating genes wherefore a prevention of hyperproliferation upon serum-treatment in hCSCs via TGFβ signalling and Ras-induced senescence is suggested.

Reduced placental blood flow causes changes in red blood cell (RBC) rheological characteristics. Herein, we used microfluidics techniques and new image flow analysis to evaluate RBC aggregation in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women. The results demonstrate that RBC aggregation depends on the disease severity and was higher in patients with preterm birth and low birth weight. The RBC aggregation indices (EAI) at low shear rates were higher for non-severe (0.107 ± 0.01) and severe PE (0.149 ± 0.05) versus controls (0.085 ± 0.01; p < 0.05). The significantly more undispersed RBC aggregates were found at high shear rates for non-severe (18.1 ± 5.5) and severe PE (25.7 ± 5.8) versus controls (14.4 ± 4.1; p < 0.05). The model experiment with in-vitro-induced oxidative stress in RBCs demonstrated that the elevated aggregation in PE RBCs can be partially due to the effect of oxidation. The results revealed that RBCs from PE patients become significantly more adhesive, forming large, branched aggregates at a low shear rate.

Based on the above evidence, it was hypothesized that brain ischemia may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Brain ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease are two diseases characterized by similar changes in the hippocampus that are closely related to memory impairment. Following brain ischemia in animals and humans, the presence of amyloid plaques in the extracellular space and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles was revealed. The phenomenon of tau protein hyperphosphorylation is a similar pathological feature of both post-ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease. In Alzheimer’s disease, the phosphorylated Thr231 motif in tau protein has two distinct trans and cis conformations and is the primary site of tau protein phosphorylation in the pre-entanglement cascade and acts as an early precursor of tau protein neuropathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. Based on the latest publication, we present a similar mechanism of the formation of neurofibrillary tangles after brain ischemia as in Alzheimer’s disease, established on trans- and cis-phosphorylation of tau protein, which ultimately influences the development of tauopathy.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970557', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063091', 'CorpusId': 268330380, 'PubMed': '38542064'}",1,"Given that experimental brain ischemia can lead to a dementia phenotype similar to Alzheimer’s disease, it is proposed that brain ischemia may play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.

Following a better understanding of the healing process, oxygen supply has been validated as a therapeutic approach to improve and speed up wound healing. Moreover, the local implications of antimicrobial agents (such as silver-based nano-compounds) significantly support the normal healing process, by combating bacterial contamination and colonization. In this study, silver (S) and tannylated calcium peroxide (CaO2@TA) nanoparticles were obtained by adapted microfluidic and precipitation synthesis methods, respectively. After complementary physicochemical evaluation, both types of nanoparticles were loaded in (Alg) alginate-based gels that were further evaluated as possible dressings for wound healing. The obtained composites showed a porous structure and uniform distribution of nanoparticles through the polymeric matrix (evidenced by spectrophotometric analysis and electron microscopy studies), together with a good swelling capacity. The as-proposed gel dressings exhibited a constant and suitable concentration of released oxygen, as shown for up to eight hours (UV–Vis investigation). The biofilm modulation data indicated a synergistic antimicrobial effect between silver and tannylated calcium peroxide nanoparticles, with a prominent inhibitory action against the Gram-positive bacterial biofilm after 48 h.

This initial bicyclic intermediate is further cyclized to isotrichodermol (ITDmol), a tricyclic precursor with a toxic trichothecene skeleton. Although the first cyclization and subsequent oxygenation are catalyzed by enzymes encoded by Tri5 and Tri4, the second cyclization occurs non-enzymatically. Following ITDmol formation, the enzymes encoded by Tri101, Tri11, Tri3, and Tri1 catalyze 3-O-acetylation, 15-hydroxylation, 15-O-acetylation, and A-ring oxygenation, respectively. In this study, we extensively analyzed the metabolites of the corresponding pathway-blocked mutants of Fusarium graminearum. The disruption of these Tri genes, except Tri3, led to the accumulation of tricyclic trichothecenes as the main products: ITDmol due to Tri101 disruption; a mixture of isotrichodermin (ITD), 7-hydroxyisotrichodermin (7-HIT), and 8-hydroxyisotrichodermin (8-HIT) due to Tri11 disruption; and a mixture of calonectrin and 3-deacetylcalonectrin due to Tri1 disruption. However, the ΔFgtri3 mutant accumulated substantial amounts of bicyclic metabolites, isotrichotriol and trichotriol, in addition to tricyclic 15-deacetylcalonectrin (15-deCAL). The ΔFgtri5ΔFgtri3 double gene disruptant transformed ITD into 7-HIT, 8-HIT, and 15-deCAL. The deletion of FgTri3 and overexpression of Tri6 and Tri10 trichothecene regulatory genes did not result in the accumulation of 15-deCAL in the transgenic strain. Thus, the absence of Tri3p and/or the presence of a small amount of 15-deCAL adversely affected the non-enzymatic second cyclization and C-15 hydroxylation steps.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050026', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084288', 'CorpusId': 269123618, 'PubMed': '38673874'}",1,"Given that trichothecene biosynthesis in Fusarium involves a series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic steps leading to toxic trichothecene compounds, we aim to investigate the role of specific Tri genes in this complex pathway. The study indicates that the disruption of certain Tri genes, such as Tri101, Tri11, and Tri1, results in the accumulation of distinct tricyclic trichothecenes, highlighting their role in subsequent hydroxylation and acetylation steps. Notably, the ΔFgtri3 mutant uniquely accumulated both bicyclic and tricyclic metabolites, suggesting that Tri3p is crucial for facilitating the non-enzymatic second cyclization and C-15 hydroxylation. These findings underscore the importance of precise gene functions in trichothecene biosynthesis and provide a foundation for further research into manipulating these pathways for potential agricultural and pharmaceutical applications."

Of the varying techniques to achieve knockout and knockdown, CRISPR base editors are emerging as promising options. However, the limited number of available, efficient target sites hampers their use for high-throughput screening. Here, we make multiple advances to enable flexible base editing as part of high-throughput genetic screening in bacteria. We first co-opt the Streptococcus canis Cas9 that exhibits more flexible protospacer-adjacent motif recognition than the traditional Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. We then expand beyond introducing premature stop codons by mutating start codons. Next, we derive guide design rules by applying machine learning to an essentiality screen conducted in Escherichia coli. Finally, we rescue poorly edited sites by combining base editing with Cas9-induced cleavage of unedited cells, thereby enriching for intended edits. The efficiency of this dual system was validated through a conditional essentiality screen based on growth in minimal media. Overall, expanding the scope of genome-wide knockout screens with base editors could further facilitate the investigation of new gene functions and interactions in bacteria.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11039988', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae174', 'CorpusId': 268523088, 'PubMed': '38499498'}",1,"Given that genome-wide screens are essential for understanding genotype-to-phenotype relationships in bacteria, the limited efficiency of current CRISPR base editors restricts their application in high-throughput settings.

They also developed guide design rules using machine learning from an essentiality screen in Escherichia coli and improved editing outcomes by combining base editing with Cas9-induced cleavage of unedited cells. These advancements collectively enable more effective genome-wide knockout screens, facilitating deeper insights into bacterial gene functions and interactions."

While adults require only the slowest AM cues to identify and discriminate speech sounds, infants have been shown to also require faster AM cues (>8–16 Hz) for similar tasks. Methods Using an observer-based psychophysical method, this study measured the ability of typical-hearing 6-month-olds, 10-month-olds, and adults to detect a change in the vowel or consonant features of consonant-vowel syllables when temporal modulations are selectively degraded. Two acoustically degraded conditions were designed, replacing FM cues with pure tones in 32 frequency bands, and then extracting AM cues in each frequency band with two different low-pass cut- off frequencies: (1) half the bandwidth (Fast AM condition), (2) <8 Hz (Slow AM condition). Results In the Fast AM condition, results show that with reduced FM cues, 85% of 6-month-olds, 72.5% of 10-month-olds, and 100% of adults successfully categorize phonemes. Among participants who passed the Fast AM condition, 67% of 6-month-olds, 75% of 10-month-olds, and 95% of adults passed the Slow AM condition. Furthermore, across the three age groups, the proportion of participants able to detect phonetic category change did not differ between the vowel and consonant conditions. However, age-related differences were observed for vowel categorization: while the 6- and 10-month-old groups did not differ from one another, they both independently differed from adults. Moreover, for consonant categorization, 10-month-olds were more impacted by acoustic temporal degradation compared to 6-month-olds, and showed a greater decline in detection success rates between the Fast AM and Slow AM conditions. Discussion The degradation of FM and faster AM cues (>8 Hz) appears to strongly affect consonant processing at 10 months of age. These findings suggest that between 6 and 10 months, infants show different developmental trajectories in the perceptual weight of speech temporal acoustic cues for vowel and consonant processing, possibly linked to phonological attunement.",2024,Frontiers in Psychology,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10848800', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1321311', 'CorpusId': 267239460, 'PubMed': '38327506'}",1,"Given that the auditory system encodes phonetic features through spectro-temporal modulations, with adults relying primarily on the slowest amplitude modulations (AM) for speech sound identification, this study explores how infants process these cues differently.

Findings indicate that while adults can effectively categorize phonemes with reduced frequency modulations (FM) and slow AM cues, infants require faster AM cues for successful phoneme categorization. Notably, 10-month-olds were more affected by the degradation of these cues compared to 6-month-olds, particularly in consonant processing, suggesting that the perceptual weight of speech temporal acoustic cues evolves between these ages and may be tied to phonological attunement.

Through structure-activity relationship studies, this hit was optimized into a potent, specific, and nongenotoxic molecule called UM4118. We demonstrated that UM4118 acts as a copper ionophore that initiates a mitochondrial-based noncanonical form of cell death known as cuproptosis. CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen further revealed that iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) deficiency enhances copper-mediated cell death. Specifically, we found that loss of the mitochondrial ISC transporter ABCB7 is synthetic lethal to UM4118. ABCB7 is misspliced and down-regulated in SF3B1-mutated leukemia, creating a vulnerability to copper ionophores. Accordingly, ABCB7 overexpression partially rescued SF3B1-mutated cells to copper overload. Together, our work provides mechanistic insights that link ISC deficiency to cuproptosis, as exemplified by the high sensitivity of SF3B1-mutated AMLs. We thus propose SF3B1 mutations as a biomarker for future copper ionophore–based therapies.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10959413', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adl4018', 'CorpusId': 268634809, 'PubMed': '38517966'}",1,"Given that SF3B1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells exhibit heightened sensitivity to a newly optimized compound called UM4118, which functions as a copper ionophore inducing cuproptosis—a mitochondrial-based noncanonical cell death—we propose investigating the therapeutic potential of copper ionophores in treating SF3B1-mutated and adverse risk AMLs. Our findings suggest that the synthetic lethality observed with the loss of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) transporter ABCB7, particularly in SF3B1-mutated contexts where ABCB7 is misspliced and down-regulated, contributes to this increased sensitivity.

Rice bran, a global staple byproduct of white rice processing, is rich in amino acids, fibers, and vitamins, when compared to other cereal brans. This pilot study examines the nutritional contribution of rice bran to the daily diets of mother–child pairs in rural southwest Guatemala. Thirty households were screened. Mothers (≥18 years) and children (6 to 24 months) completed 24 h dietary recalls at baseline and after 12 weeks (endline) for diet intake and diversity analyses. During biweekly visits for 12 weeks, households with <5 members received 14 packets containing 60 g of heat-stabilized rice bran, and those with ≥5 members received 28 packets. The macro- and micro-nutrient contributions of rice bran and whole, cooked black beans were included in dietary simulation models with average intakes established between the recalls and for comparison with dietary reference intakes (DRIs). A baseline child food frequency questionnaire was administered. The 27 mothers and 23 children with complete recalls were included in analyses. Daily maternal consumption of 10 g/d of rice bran plus 100 g/d of black beans resulted in all achieving at least 50% of the fiber, protein, magnesium, niacin, potassium, and thiamin DRIs. Daily child consumption of 3 g/d of rice bran plus 10 g/d of black beans resulted in all achieving at least 50% of the magnesium, niacin, phosphorous, and thiamine DRIs. For 15/17 food categories, male children had a higher intake frequency, notably for animal-source foods and coffee.

Treatment with antifungals meets with little success, whereas prosthesis removal improves the outcome. In fact, Candida spp. adhere to orthopedic devices and grow forming biofilms that contribute to the persistence of this infection and relapse, and there is insufficient evidence that the use of antifungals has additional benefits for anti-biofilm activity. To date, studies on the direct antifungal activity of silver against Candida spp. are still scanty. Additionally, polycaprolactone (PCL), either pure or blended with calcium phosphate, could be a good candidate for the design of 3D scaffolds as engineered bone graft substitutes. Thus, the present research aimed to assess the antifungal and anti-biofilm activity of PCL-based constructs by the addition of antimicrobials, for instance, silver, against C. albicans and C. auris. The appearance of an inhibition halo around silver-functionalized PCL scaffolds for both C. albicans and C. auris was revealed, and a significant decrease in both adherent and planktonic yeasts further demonstrated the release of Ag+ from the 3D constructs. Due to the combined antifungal, osteoproliferative, and biodegradable properties, PCL-based 3D scaffolds enriched with silver showed good potential for bone tissue engineering and offer a promising strategy as an ideal anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm tool for the reduction in prosthetic joints of infections caused by Candida spp. by using antimicrobial molecule-targeted delivery.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10931636', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25052784', 'CorpusId': 268181542, 'PubMed': '38474027'}",1,"Given that Candida spp. periprosthetic joint infections are challenging to treat due to their biofilm-forming capabilities and resistance to conventional antifungals, there is a need for innovative treatment strategies.

B cell abnormalities and the production of autoantibodies against nuclear complexes like anti-dsDNA are recognised as key players in the pathogenesis of LN. To address the challenges of chronic immunosuppression associated with current therapies, we have engineered T cells to express chimeric autoantibody receptors (DNA-CAART) for the precise targeting of B cells expressing anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. T cells from LN patients were transduced using six different CAAR vectors based on their antigen specificity, including alpha-actinin, histone-1, heparan sulphate, or C1q. The cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and cell–cell contact of DNA-CAART were thoroughly investigated in co-culture experiments with B cells isolated from patients, both with and without anti-dsDNA positivity. The therapeutic effects were further evaluated using an in vitro immune kidney LN organoid. Among the six proposed DNA-CAART, DNA4 and DNA6 demonstrated superior selectively cytotoxic activity against anti-dsDNA+ B cells. Notably, DNA4-CAART exhibited improvements in organoid morphology, apoptosis, and the inflammatory process in the presence of IFNα-stimulated anti-dsDNA+ B cells. Based on these findings, DNA4-CAART emerge as promising candidates for modulating autoimmunity and represent a novel approach for the treatment of LN.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050013', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084226', 'CorpusId': 269108680, 'PubMed': '38673811'}",1,"Given that lupus nephritis (LN) remains a significant health challenge due to persistent B cell abnormalities and the production of autoantibodies despite conventional therapy, this study investigates a novel therapeutic approach utilizing chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells (DNA-CAART) to target B cells expressing anti-dsDNA autoantibodies.

Organoids can mimic tumor development in vitro, but current Matrigel inaccurately replicates the tissue-specific microenvironment. This limitation compromises the accurate representation of tumor heterogeneity. We collected para-cancerous cervical tissues from patients diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and prepared uterine cervix extracellular matrix (UCEM) hydrogels. Proteomic analysis of UCEM identified several tissue-specific signaling pathways including human papillomavirus, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT, and extracellular matrix receptor. Secreted proteins like FLNA, MYH9, HSPA8, and EEF1A1 were present, indicating UCEM successfully maintained cervical proteins. UCEM provided a tailored microenvironment for CSCC organoids, enabling formation and growth while preserving tumorigenic potential. RNA sequencing showed UCEM-organoids exhibited greater similarity to native CSCC and reflected tumor heterogeneity by exhibiting CSCC-associated signaling pathways including virus protein-cytokine, nuclear factor κB, tumor necrosis factor, and oncogenes EGR1, FPR1, and IFI6. Moreover, UCEM-organoids developed chemotherapy resistance.

The scientific literature has primarily examined the effectiveness of PAPE alone or combined with caffeine (CAF) intake in all-out tests lasting ≤10 s, as the effect of PAPE is transitory. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a protocol to induce PAPE alone or in combination with caffeine intake on the 30 s Wingate Anaerobic Test in highly trained boxers. Twenty-five male and highly trained boxers (mean age: 20 ± 1 years) participated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study consisting of three different experimental conditions: (i) control (CON), with no substance intake and no PAPE protocol before the Wingate Anaerobic Test; (ii) PAPE + PLA, involving the intake of a placebo 60 min before and a PAPE protocol comprising a 10 s cycling sprint overloaded with 8.5% of the participants’ body weight 10 min before the Wingate Anaerobic Test; and (iii) PAPE + CAF, involving the intake of 3 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min before and the same PAPE protocol used in the (ii) protocol before the Wingate Anaerobic Test. In all conditions, the participants performed the 30 s version of the Wingate Anaerobic Test with a load equivalent to 7.5% of their body weight, while the cycle ergometer setting was replicated. Immediately following the Wingate test, heart rate (HR), the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and blood lactate concentration (Bla) were measured. In comparison to CON, PAPE + PLA enhanced mean power (p = 0.024; Effect size [ES] = 0.37) and total work (p = 0.022; ES = 0.38) during the Wingate test, accompanied by an increase in post-test blood lactate concentration (p < 0.01; ES = 0.83). In comparison to CON, PAPE + CAF enhanced mean power (p = 0.001; ES = 0.57), peak power (p = 0.013; ES = 0.57), total work (p = 0.001; ES = 0.53), post-test blood lactate concentration (p < 0.001; ES = 1.43) and participants’ subjective perception of power (p = 0.041). There were no differences in any variable between PAPE + PLA and PAPE + CAF. In summary, a PAPE protocol that involves a 10 s all-out sprint 10 min before the Wingate Anaerobic Test was effective in enhancing Wingate mean power in highly trained boxers. The addition of 3 mg/kg of caffeine to the PAPE protocol produced an effect on mean power of a higher magnitude than PAPE alone, and it enhanced peak power along with participants’ subjective perception of power. From a practical point of view, PAPE before exercise seems to be an effective approach for increasing Wingate performance in highly trained boxers, while the addition of caffeine can increase some benefits, especially peak power.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10820078', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020235', 'CorpusId': 266973884, 'PubMed': '38257128'}",1,"Given that post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) can acutely excite the neuromuscular system and improve subsequent physical performance, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a PAPE protocol alone or combined with caffeine intake on the 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test in highly trained boxers.

The findings indicated that PAPE alone enhanced mean power and total work during the Wingate test, with an increase in blood lactate levels. When combined with caffeine, the PAPE protocol further enhanced mean power, peak power, total work, and subjective perception of power. Therefore, implementing a PAPE protocol before exercise can effectively enhance Wingate performance in highly trained boxers, and adding caffeine can amplify some of these benefits, particularly peak power."

However, their biosynthetic capabilities remain largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed 81 metagenomes, 33 metatranscriptomes, and 7 metabolomes derived from nine different cold seep areas to investigate their secondary metabolites. Cold seep microbiomes encode diverse and abundant biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Most BGCs are affiliated with understudied bacteria and archaea, including key mediators of methane and sulfur cycling. The BGCs encode diverse antimicrobial compounds that potentially shape community dynamics and various metabolites predicted to influence biogeochemical cycling. BGCs from key players are widely distributed and highly expressed, with their abundance and expression levels varying with sediment depth.

A surface-exposed domain inserted into the catalytic trigger loop (TL) of Escherichia coli RNAP, called SI3, modulates pausing and is essential for growth. Here we describe a viable E. coli strain lacking SI3 enabled by a suppressor TL substitution (β′Ala941→Thr; ΔSI3*). ΔSI3* increased transcription rate in vitro relative to ΔSI3, possibly explaining its viability, but retained both positive and negative effects of ΔSI3 on pausing. ΔSI3* inhibited pauses stabilized by nascent RNA structures (pause hairpins; PHs) but enhanced other pauses. Using NET-seq, we found that ΔSI3*-enhanced pauses resemble the consensus elemental pause sequence whereas sequences at ΔSI3*-suppressed pauses, which exhibited greater association with PHs, were more divergent. ΔSI3*-suppressed pauses also were associated with apparent pausing one nucleotide upstream from the consensus sequence, often generating tandem pause sites. These ‘–2 pauses’ were stimulated by pyrophosphate in vitro and by addition of apyrase to degrade residual NTPs during NET-seq sample processing. We propose that some pauses are readily reversible by pyrophosphorolysis or single-nucleotide cleavage.

Thiolutin and the related dithiolopyrrolone holomycin chelate Zn2+ and previous studies have concluded that RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) inhibition in vivo is indirect. Here, we present chemicogenetic and biochemical approaches to investigate thiolutin's mode of action in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify mutants that alter sensitivity to thiolutin. We provide genetic evidence that thiolutin causes oxidation of thioredoxins in vivo and that thiolutin both induces oxidative stress and interacts functionally with multiple metals including Mn2+ and Cu2+, and not just Zn2+. Finally, we show direct inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation by thiolutin in vitro in support of classical studies that thiolutin can directly inhibit transcription in vitro. Inhibition requires both Mn2+ and appropriate reduction of thiolutin as excess DTT abrogates its effects. Pause prone, defective elongation can be observed in vitro if inhibition is bypassed.

The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri and products of tryptophan degradation, specifically the neuroactive kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA), have received special attention in this context. We, therefore, assessed relevant features of KP metabolism, namely, the cellular uptake of the pivotal metabolite kynurenine and its conversion to its primary products KYNA, 3-hydroxykynurenine and anthranilic acid in L. reuteri by incubating the bacteria in Hank’s Balanced Salt solution in vitro. Kynurenine readily entered the bacterial cells and was preferentially converted to KYNA, which was promptly released into the extracellular milieu. De novo production of KYNA increased linearly with increasing concentrations of kynurenine (up to 1 mM) and bacteria (107 to 109 CFU/mL) and with incubation time (1–3 h). KYNA neosynthesis was blocked by two selective inhibitors of mammalian kynurenine aminotransferase II (PF-048559989 and BFF-122). In contrast to mammals, however, kynurenine uptake was not influenced by other substrates of the mammalian large neutral amino acid transporter, and KYNA production was not affected by the presumed competitive enzyme substrates (glutamine and α-aminoadipate). Taken together, these results reveal substantive qualitative differences between bacterial and mammalian KP metabolism.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11011989', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073679', 'CorpusId': 268743395, 'PubMed': '38612489'}",1,"Given that the gut–brain axis is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, this study explores the role of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri in kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolism, focusing on the conversion of kynurenine to its neuroactive metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA). The research demonstrates that L. reuteri efficiently takes up kynurenine and preferentially converts it to KYNA, which is then released extracellularly. This process is distinct from mammalian KP metabolism as it is unaffected by substrates and inhibitors that typically influence mammalian enzyme activity. These findings suggest that L. reuteri could modulate neuroactive compounds in the gut, potentially impacting neuropsychiatric health through mechanisms different from those in mammals."

This study aimed to investigate the association between the expression of three miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-205-5p, and miR-222-3p) in endometrial cancer tissues. In addition, the stability of expression of SNORD48 and U6, which were initially planned to be used as reference miRNAs for normalization, was investigated. Endometrial tissue was obtained from 111 patients with EC during hysterectomy and from 19 patients undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids or pelvic organ prolapse as a control group without neoplastic changes. Our study was based on calculations made with a digital PCR method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to measure the absolute expression. In the endometrial cancer tissue, miR-205-5p was upregulated, while miR-222-3p and SNORD48 were downregulated compared to the control group. We detected statistically significant correlation of miR-205-5p, U6, and SNORD48 expression with different histological grades; the expression of miR-205-5p increases with the histopathological grade advancement (intraepithelial neoplasia- EIN = 1590, G1 = 3367.2, G2 = 8067 and G3 = 20,360), while U6 and SNORD expression decreases from EIN to G2 and increases again in the G3 grade (U6: EIN = 19,032, G1 = 16,482.4, G2 = 13,642.4, G3 = 133,008; SNORD48: EIN = 97,088, G1 = 59,520, G2 = 43,544, G3 = 227,200). Our study suggests that upregulation of miR-205-5p and downregulation of miR-222-3p and SNORD48 may influence development of endometrial cancer. Moreover, miR-205-5p, U6, and SNORD48 expression changes may be associated with progression of endometrial cancer. The results also indicate that SNORD48 and U6, commonly used as internal references, may influence endometrial cancer development and progression; therefore, they should not be used as references. However, it is important to note that further research is required to understand their role in endometrial cancer.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10969921', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063286', 'CorpusId': 268440320, 'PubMed': '38542261'}",1,"Given that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in carcinogenesis, including endometrial cancer (EC), this study investigates the expression patterns of miR-21-5p, miR-205-5p, and miR-222-3p in EC tissues.

Additionally, the expression levels of miR-205-5p, U6, and SNORD48 correlate with different histological grades of EC, suggesting that these miRNAs may contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Importantly, the findings also challenge the suitability of SNORD48 and U6 as reference miRNAs for normalization in EC studies due to their variable expression in different cancer grades. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise roles of these miRNAs in endometrial cancer."

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is associated with severe CRS phenotypes. Different animal models have been proposed to study the association of CRS and S. aureus. However, current animal models are expensive due to the use of large animals, have high barriers to ethics approval, or require invasive surgical intervention, necessitating a need for a model that can overcome these limitations. This study aimed at establishing a reliable and efficient rat lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory model for rhinosinusitis. Sprague Dawley rats received a daily intranasal application of 20 μL of saline, S. aureus CI-182 exoprotein (250 μg/mL), or exoprotein CI-182 in combination with S. aureus clinical isolate (CI-908 or CI-913) 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL. The rats’ sinuses were harvested at 1 and 2 weeks post-intervention. The CFU and histopathologic examination of inflammation were evaluated. S. aureus clinical isolates CI-908 or CI-913 in combination with the exoprotein (CI-182) had higher CFUs and caused persistently higher inflammation at both the 1 and 2-week post-intervention compared to the exoprotein and saline group. The observed inflammatory cell type was lymphoplasmacytic. This study provided evidence that the combination of a S. aureus exoprotein with S. aureus induces inflammation that persists for a minimum of two weeks post-intervention. This model is the first known animal model to create the lymphoplasmacytic inflammation subtype seen in CRS patients.

They constantly fuse and divide to maintain mitochondrial functions. Defective mitochondrial fission is implicated in cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. However, the heterogeneous nature, varied mechanisms, and roles of fission remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified a mechanistically and functionally distinct type of fission that initiates with the protrusion of a tail-like tubule followed by its disconnection, resembling tail autotomy. The tail-autotomy fission is driven by tensile force and can shed exclusively the outer membrane into matrix-excluded vesicles that can recruit mitophagic proteins for further degradation. Longer force application causes more fission and generation of matrix-excluded vesicles. These findings provide insights into the heterogeneity and mechanoregulation of mitochondrial fission.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10998583', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2217019121', 'CorpusId': 268739978, 'PubMed': '38547062'}",1,"Given that mitochondrial fission is crucial for cellular health and implicated in numerous diseases, our research proposes to investigate a newly identified type of fission called tail-autotomy fission.

The ternary phase diagrams were determined, stressing that FILs highly increased the ability for ABS formation. The functionalized ABSs (FILs vs. mere fluoro-containing ILs) were used to extract lysozyme (Lys). The ABSs’ biphasic regions were screened in terms of protein biocompatibility, analyzing the impact of ABS phase-forming components in Lys by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, DSC, and enzyme assay. Lys partition behavior was characterized in terms of extraction efficiency (% EE). The structure, stability, and function of Lys were maintained or improved throughout the extraction step, as evaluated by CD spectroscopy, DSC, enzyme assay, and SDS-PAGE. Overall, FIL-based ABSs are more versatile and amenable to being tuned by the adequate choice of the phase-forming components and selecting the enriched phase. Binding studies between Lys and ABS phase-forming components were attained by MST, demonstrating the strong interaction between Lys and FILs aggregates. Two of the FIL-based ABSs (30 %wt [C2C1Im][C4F9SO3] + 2 %wt K3PO4 and 30 %wt [C2C1Im][C4F9SO3] + 25 %wt sucrose) allowed the simultaneous purification of Lys and BSA in a single ABS extraction step with high yield (extraction efficiency up to 100%) for both proteins. The purity of both recovered proteins was validated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Even with a high-charge density salt, the FIL-based ABSs developed in this work seem more amenable to be tuned. Lys and BSA were purified through selective partition to opposite phases in a single FIL-based ABS extraction step. FIL-based ABSs are proposed as an improved extraction step for proteins, based on their biocompatibility, customizable properties, and selectivity.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11172314', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25115766', 'CorpusId': 270077320, 'PubMed': '38891953'}",1,"Given that functionalized ionic liquid (FIL)-based aqueous biphasic systems (ABSs) demonstrate superior versatility and biocompatibility compared to mere fluoro-containing ILs, our research proposes to explore the potential of FIL-based ABSs for efficient protein extraction and purification.

Through various spectroscopic and analytical methods, it was shown that FIL-based ABSs could achieve high extraction yields and purity for proteins like lysozyme (Lys) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a single step, highlighting their customizable and selective nature. This proposes a promising avenue for the development of optimized protein purification processes utilizing FIL-based ABSs."

Blood samples of 18 patients (nine time points up to 168 h post-administration) were analyzed for radiation-induced γ-H2AX + 53BP1 DNA double-strand break foci (RIF). A linear one-compartment model described the absorbed dose-dependent time course of RIF (Parameters: c characterizes DSB damage induction; k1 and k2 are rate constants describing fast and slow repair). The rate constants were compared to ex vivo repair rates. A total of 14 patient datasets could be analyzed; c ranged from 0.012 to 0.109 mGy−1, k2 from 0 to 0.04 h−1. On average, 96% of the damage is repaired quickly with k1 (range: 0.19–3.03 h−1). Two patient subgroups were distinguished by k1-values (n = 6, k1 > 1.1 h−1; n = 8, k1 < 0.6 h−1). A weak correlation with patient age was observed. While induction of RIF was similar among ex vivo and in vivo, the respective repair rates failed to correlate.

The amorphous nature of FIS in ASDs and ASIs was confirmed using XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction). DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry) confirmed full miscibility of multicomponent delivery systems. FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared analysis) confirmed interactions that stabilize FIS’s amorphous state and identified the functional groups involved. The study culminated in evaluating the impact of amorphization on water solubility and conducting in vitro antioxidant assays: 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)—ABTS, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl—DPPH, Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity—CUPRAC, and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power—FRAP and in vitro neuroprotective assays: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase—AChE and butyrylcholinesterase—BChE. In addition, molecular docking allowed for the determination of possible bonds and interactions between FIS and the mentioned above enzymes. The best preparation turned out to be ASI_30_EPO (ASD fisetin-Eudragit® containing 30% FIS in combination with HP-β-cyclodextrin), which showed an improvement in apparent solubility (126.5 ± 0.1 µg∙mL−1) and antioxidant properties (ABTS: IC50 = 10.25 µg∙mL−1, DPPH: IC50 = 27.69 µg∙mL−1, CUPRAC: IC0.5 = 9.52 µg∙mL−1, FRAP: IC0.5 = 8.56 µg∙mL−1) and neuroprotective properties (inhibition AChE: 39.91%, and BChE: 42.62%).",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11011862', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073648', 'CorpusId': 268714008, 'PubMed': '38612460'}",1,"Given that amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) and ternary amorphous solid inclusions (ASIs) of fisetin (FIS) were successfully prepared and characterized using a solvent-free mechanochemical method, this study proposes that multicomponent amorphous delivery systems can significantly enhance the solubility and bioactivity of poorly water-soluble compounds.

Here, we developed an in vitro model whereby human colon fibroblasts are induced by specific cytokines and recapitulate key features of IAFs in vivo. When cocultured with patient-derived colon organoids (colonoids), IAFs induced rapid colonoid expansion and barrier disruption due to swelling and rupture of individual epithelial cells. Colonoids cocultured with IAFs also show increased DNA damage, mitotic errors, and proliferation arrest. These IAF-induced epithelial defects are mediated by a paracrine pathway involving prostaglandin E2 and its receptor EP4, leading to protein kinase A -dependent activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. EP4-specific chemical inhibitors effectively prevented IAF-induced colonoid swelling and restored normal proliferation and genome stability.

Little is known about how their molecular ancestors began to enforce the coding rules for the expression of their own genes. Schimmel et al. proposed in 1993 that AARS catalytic domains began by reading an ‘operational’ code in the acceptor stems of tRNA minihelices. We show here that the enzymology of an AARS urzyme•TΨC-minihelix cognate pair is a rich in vitro realization of that idea. The TΨC-minihelixLeu is a very poor substrate for full-length Leucyl-tRNA synthetase. It is a superior RNA substrate for the corresponding urzyme, LeuAC. LeuAC active-site mutations shift the choice of both amino acid and RNA substrates. AARS urzyme•minihelix cognate pairs are thus small, pliant models for the ancestral decoding hardware. They are thus an ideal platform for detailed experimental study of the operational RNA code.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11229368', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae417', 'CorpusId': 269985541, 'PubMed': '38783009'}",1,"Given that the molecular ancestors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) and tRNAs played a crucial role in enforcing genetic coding rules, this study explores the enzymatic interactions between an AARS urzyme and a TΨC-minihelix, supporting Schimmel et al.'s 1993 hypothesis regarding the operational code in tRNA minihelices. The researchers demonstrated that the TΨC-minihelixLeu serves as an effective substrate for the corresponding AARS urzyme, LeuAC, but not for the full-length enzyme, highlighting the flexibility and specificity of these ancestral molecular interactions. These findings suggest that AARS urzyme•minihelix pairs provide a minimalistic and functional model for studying the early mechanisms of genetic code translation, offering a promising platform for further experimental investigation into the operational RNA code."

They consist of follicles with lymphocytes and an overlying subepithelial dome with dendritic cells and macrophages, and they are covered by the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE). A sealed paracellular pathway in the FAE is crucial for the controlled uptake of luminal antigens. Quercetin is the most abundant plant flavonoid and has a barrier-strengthening effect on tight junctions (TJs), a protein complex that regulates the paracellular pathway. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of quercetin on porcine PPs and the surrounding villus epithelium (VE). We incubated both tissue types for 4 h in Ussing chambers, recorded the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and measured the unidirectional tracer flux of [3H]-mannitol. Subsequently, we analyzed the expression, protein amount, and localization of three TJ proteins, claudin 1, claudin 2, and claudin 4. In the PPs, we could not detect an effect of quercetin after 4 h, neither on TEER nor on the [3H]-mannitol flux. In the VE, quercetin led to a higher TEER value, while the [3H]-mannitol flux was unchanged. The pore-forming claudin 2 was decreased while the barrier-forming claudin 4 was increased and the expression was upregulated. Claudin 1 was unchanged and all claudins could be located in the paracellular membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Such adipose tissue expansion relies on effective degradation of collagen structures that surround the growing adipocytes. Here, we found that the rise in degraded collagen during adipose tissue expansion is linked to increased macrophage-mediated collagen uptake. However, macrophages lose this ability in obesity, leading to accumulation of collagen fragments in adipose tissue. These collagen fragments are not just waste products but exert biological actions. For example, we found that they stimulate macrophage proliferation and cause fibroinflammatory effects in fibroblasts.

Nevertheless, the impact of iron supplementation on the gut microbiota of middle-aged women remains unclear. To investigate the association between iron supplementation and the gut microbiota, healthy females aged 40–65 years (n = 56, BMI = 23 ± 2.6 kg/m2) were retrospectively analyzed from the Alberta’s Tomorrow Project. Fecal samples along with various lifestyle, diet, and health questionnaires were obtained. The gut microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Individuals were matched by age and BMI and classified as either taking no iron supplement, a low-dose iron supplement (6–10 mg iron/day), or high-dose iron (>100 mg/day). Compositional and functional analyses of microbiome data in relation to iron supplementation were investigated using various bioinformatics tools. Results revealed that iron supplementation had a dose-dependent effect on microbial communities. Elevated iron intake (>100 mg) was associated with an augmentation of Proteobacteria and a reduction in various taxa, including Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Verrucomicrobia, Ruminococcus, Alistipes, and Faecalibacterium. Metagenomic prediction further suggested the upregulation of iron acquisition and siderophore biosynthesis following high iron intake.

These findings highlight the necessity of optimizing iron dosage to support both iron levels and gut health, suggesting a complex interplay between supplementation and microbial balance that warrants further investigation."

PDAC predominantly arises from non-cystic pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and cystic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). We used multiplex immunofluorescence and computational imaging technology to characterize, map, and compare the immune microenvironments (IMEs) of PDAC and its precursor lesions. We demonstrate that the IME of IPMN was abundantly infiltrated with CD8+ T cells and PD-L1-positive antigen-presenting cells (APCs), whereas the IME of PanIN contained fewer CD8+ T cells and fewer PD-L1-positive APCs but elevated numbers of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Thus, immunosuppression in IPMN and PanIN seems to be mediated by different mechanisms. While immunosuppression in IPMN is facilitated by PD-L1 expression on APCs, Tregs seem to play a key role in PanIN. Our findings suggest potential immunotherapeutic interventions for high-risk precursor lesions, namely, targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in IPMN and CTLA-4-positive Tregs in PanIN to restore immunosurveillance and prevent progression to cancer. Tregs accumulate with malignant transformation, as observed in PDAC, and to a lesser extent in IPMN-associated PDAC (IAPA). High numbers of Tregs in the microenvironment of PDAC went along with a markedly decreased interaction between CD8+ T cells and cancerous epithelial cells (ECs), highlighting the importance of Tregs as key players in immunosuppression in PDAC. We found evidence that a defect in antigen presentation, further aggravated by PD-L1 expression on APC, may contribute to immunosuppression in IAPA, suggesting a role for PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of IAPA.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10932200', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25052953', 'CorpusId': 268370252, 'PubMed': '38474199'}",1,"Given that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) arises from distinct precursor lesions with differing immune microenvironments (IMEs), our research seeks to characterize these IMEs to inform targeted immunotherapeutic strategies. This study employed multiplex immunofluorescence and computational imaging to map the immune landscapes of PDAC and its precursors, non-cystic PanIN and cystic IPMN. The findings reveal that IPMN's IME is rich in CD8+ T cells and PD-L1-positive antigen-presenting cells (APCs), suggesting a potential for PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy. In contrast, the PanIN IME is dominated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs), pointing towards CTLA-4 inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach. This differential immunosuppressive mechanism extends to PDAC, where Tregs play a significant role, and IAPA, where antigen presentation defects and PD-L1 expression on APCs further contribute to immune evasion. These insights propose that tailored immunotherapeutic interventions could restore immune surveillance and potentially prevent the progression of high-risk precursor lesions to full-blown cancer."

Fragile-X-related disorders (FXDs) are genetic conditions that occur due to the dynamic expansion of CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene encoding for the RNA-binding protein FMRP, particularly expressed in the brain. This gene expansion can lead to premutation (PM, 56–200 CGGs), full mutation (FM, >200 CGGs), or unmethylated FM (UFM), resulting in neurodegeneration, neurodevelopmental disorders, or no apparent intellectual disability, respectively. To investigate the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD patients, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics in fibroblasts derived from patients. Donut-shaped mitochondrial morphology and excessive synthesis of critical mitochondrial proteins were detected in FM, PM, and UFM cells. Analysis of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in situ reveals lower respiration in PM fibroblasts. Importantly, mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent apoptosis is sensitized to reactive oxygen species in FM, PM, and UFM models. This study elucidated the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD phenotypes, and indicated altered mitochondrial function and morphology. Importantly, a sensitization to permeability transition and apoptosis was revealed in FXD cells. Overall, our data suggest that mitochondria are novel drug targets to relieve the FXD symptoms.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970216', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063421', 'CorpusId': 268528416, 'PubMed': '38542395'}",1,"Given that mitochondria play a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, our research aims to explore the mitochondrial mechanisms involved in Fragile-X-related disorders (FXDs), which result from CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene.

This study investigated the anti-cancer activities of 30 monomers extracted from Morus alba L. (mulberry) against gastrointestinal cancers. Toxicological assessments revealed that most of the compounds, particularly immunotoxicity, exhibit some level of toxicity, but it is generally not life-threatening under normal conditions. Among these components, Sanggenol L, Sanggenon C, Kuwanon H, 3′-Geranyl-3-prenyl-5,7,2′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone, Morusinol, Mulberrin, Moracin P, Kuwanon E, and Kuwanon A demonstrate significant anti-cancer properties against various gastrointestinal cancers, including colon, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. The anti-cancer mechanism of these chemical components was explored in gastric cancer cells, revealing that they inhibit cell cycle and DNA replication-related gene expression, leading to the effective suppression of tumor cell growth. Additionally, they induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, potentially resulting in DNA damage, autophagy, and cell death. Moracin P, an active monomer characterized as a 2-arylbenzofuran, was found to induce ER stress and promote apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, confirming its potential to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

We determined the expression and gene regulatory functions of ERβ in dormant primordial follicles (PdFs) and activated primary follicles (PrFs) using mouse models. PdFs and PrFs were isolated from 3-week-old Erβ knockout (Erβnull) mouse ovaries, and their transcriptomes were compared with those of control Erβfl/fl mice. We observed a significant (≥2-fold change; FDR p-value ≤ 0.05) deregulation of approximately 5% of genes (866 out of 16,940 genes, TPM ≥ 5) in Erβnull PdFs; ~60% (521 out of 866) of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 40% were downregulated, indicating that ERβ has both transcriptional enhancing as well as repressing roles in dormant PdFs. Such deregulation of genes may make the Erβnull PdFs more susceptible to increased PFGA. When the PdFs undergo PFGA and form PrFs, many new genes are activated. During PFGA of Erβfl/fl follicles, we detected a differential expression of ~24% genes (4909 out of 20,743; ≥2-fold change; FDR p-value ≤ 0.05; TPM ≥ 5); 56% upregulated and 44% downregulated, indicating the gene enhancing and repressing roles of Erβ-activated PrFs. In contrast, we detected a differential expression of only 824 genes in Erβnull follicles during PFGA (≥2-fold change; FDR p-value ≤ 0.05; TPM ≥ 5). Moreover, most (~93%; 770 out of 824) of these DEGs in activated Erβnull PrFs were downregulated. Such deregulation of genes in Erβnull activated follicles may impair their inhibitory role on PFGA. Notably, in both Erβnull PdFs and PrFs, we detected a significant number of epigenetic regulators and transcription factors to be differentially expressed, which suggests that lack of ERβ either directly or indirectly deregulates the gene expression in PdFs and PrFs, leading to increased PFGA.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970686', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063202', 'CorpusId': 268496854, 'PubMed': '38542176'}",1,"Given that loss of ERβ leads to the increased activation of primordial follicle growth and subsequent depletion of the ovarian follicle reserve, this study aimed to elucidate the gene regulatory functions of ERβ in both dormant primordial follicles (PdFs) and activated primary follicles (PrFs).

This suggests that ERβ functions as both a transcriptional enhancer and repressor, influencing the gene expression critical to follicle activation and growth. The study highlights the role of ERβ in maintaining the balance of follicle activation, where its absence may lead to premature activation and depletion of follicle reserves due to the dysregulation of gene expression and epigenetic regulators. This provides a foundation for further exploration into ERβ's specific regulatory mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions related to ovarian follicle reserve depletion."

These activities require the formation of a nucleoprotein complex in which the DNA adopts a right-handed superhelix wrapping around a multimeric p6 scaffold, restraining positive supercoiling and compacting the viral genome. Due to the absence of homologous structures, prior attempts to unveil p6’s structural architecture failed. Here, we employed AlphaFold2 to engineer rational p6 constructs yielding crystals for three-dimensional structure determination. Our findings reveal a novel fold adopted by p6 that sheds light on its self-association mechanism and its interaction with DNA. By means of protein–DNA docking and molecular dynamic simulations, we have generated a comprehensive structural model for the nucleoprotein complex that consistently aligns with its established biochemical and thermodynamic parameters. Besides, through analytical ultracentrifugation, we have confirmed the hydrodynamic properties of the nucleocomplex, further validating in solution our proposed model. Importantly, the disclosed structure not only provides a highly accurate explanation for previously experimental data accumulated over decades, but also enhances our holistic understanding of the structural and functional attributes of protein p6 during φ29 infection.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10899789', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae041', 'CorpusId': 267309624, 'PubMed': '38281216'}",1,"Given that the genome-organizing protein p6 of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage φ29 is crucial for viral DNA replication and transcriptional regulation through the formation of a nucleoprotein complex, this research proposes to elucidate the structural mechanism of p6.

We tested whether boosting the synthesis of neural-derived 17β-estradiol (nE2) saves hippocampal LTP by the neurotoxic action of Aβ42. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure dentate gyrus (DG) LTP in rat hippocampal slices. Using a pharmacological approach, we tested the ability of nE2 to counteract the LTP impairment caused by acute exposure to soluble Aβ42 aggregates. nE2 was found to be required for LTP in DG under physiological conditions. Blockade of steroid 5α-reductase with finasteride, by increasing nE2 synthesis from testosterone (T), completely recovered LTP in slices treated with soluble Aβ42 aggregates. Modulation of the glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) by memantine effectively rescued the LTP deficit observed in slices exposed to Aβ42, and memantine prevented LTP reduction observed under the blocking of nE2 synthesis. nE2 is able to counteract Aβ42-induced synaptic dysfunction. This effect depends on a rapid, non-genomic mechanism of action of nE2, which may share a common pathway with glutamate NMDAR signaling.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855267', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031377', 'CorpusId': 267226003, 'PubMed': '38338656'}",1,"Given that amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42) aggregates impair hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and that 17β-estradiol (nE2) is crucial for this process, our research proposes investigating whether enhancing the synthesis of nE2 can mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ42 on hippocampal LTP. The study indicates that nE2 is essential for maintaining LTP in the dentate gyrus under normal conditions and that increasing nE2 synthesis can fully restore LTP in the presence of Aβ42 aggregates. Additionally, modulation of the glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) with memantine also rescues LTP deficits caused by Aβ42 and prevents LTP reduction when nE2 synthesis is inhibited. These findings suggest that nE2 counteracts Aβ42-induced synaptic dysfunction through a rapid, non-genomic mechanism possibly linked to NMDAR signaling."

Due to its rarity and unclear etiopathogenesis, therapeutic options for NL are not well-standardized. Among them, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an emerging tool, although its efficacy has primarily been evaluated in single case reports or small case series. This study reports the real-life experience of a cohort of NL patients treated with PDT at the Section of Dermatology of the University Hospital of Messina and Reggio-Emilia. From 2013 to 2023, 17 patients were enrolled —5 males (29%) and 12 females (71%) aged between 16 and 56 years (mean age: 42 ± 13 years), with a median duration of NL of 8 years. The overall complete clearance (>75% lesion reduction) was 29%, while the partial clearance (25–75% lesion reduction) was 59%, with 12% being non-responders. This study adds to the little amount of evidence present in the literature regarding the effectiveness of PDT in the treatment of NL. Variability in treatment responses among patients underscores the need for personalized protocols, optimizing photosensitizers, light sources, and dosimetry.

Time-series gene expression and IP biomarker data were generated from “breachers” exposed to controlled, low-level explosive blast during training. Samples from 30 male participants at pre-, post-, and follow-up blast exposure the next day were assayed via RNA-seq and ELISA. A battery of symptom data was also collected at each of these time points that acutely showed elevated symptom reporting related to headache, concentration, dizziness, and taking longer to think, dissipating ~16 h following blast exposure. Evidence for bacterial translocation into circulation following blast exposure was detected by significant stepwise increase in microbial diversity (measured via alpha-diversity p = 0.049). Alterations in levels of IP protein biomarkers (i.e., Zonulin, LBP, Claudin-3, I-FABP) assessed in a subset of these participants (n = 23) further evidenced blast exposure associates with IP. The observed symptom profile was consistent with mild traumatic brain injury and was further associated with changes in bacterial translocation and intestinal permeability, suggesting that IP may be linked to a decrease in cognitive functioning. These preliminary findings show for the first time within real-world military operational settings that exposures to blast can contribute to IP.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10971443', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063549', 'CorpusId': 268628425, 'PubMed': '38542520'}",1,"Given that exposure to blasts in military settings is associated with concussion-like symptoms and physiological changes such as increased intestinal permeability (IP), this study investigated these effects in ""breachers"" during tactical training.

Because of the lack of suitable chemotherapeutic agents for treatment, the 5-year survival rate of melanoma patients with regional and distant metastases is lower than 10%. Targeted tumor therapy that provides several promising results might be a good option for the treatment of malignant melanomas. Our goal was to develop novel melanoma-specific peptide–drug conjugates for targeted tumor therapy. Melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) is a cell surface receptor responsible for melanogenesis and it is overexpressed on the surface of melanoma cells, providing a good target. Its native ligand, α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) peptide, or its derivatives, might be potential homing devices for this purpose. Therefore, we prepared three α-MSH derivative–daunomycin (Dau) conjugates and their in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities were compared. Dau has an autofluorescence property; therefore, it is suitable for preparing conjugates for in vitro (e.g., cellular uptake) and in vivo experiments. Dau was attached to the peptides via a non-cleavable oxime linkage that was applied efficiently in our previous experiments, resulting in conjugates with high tumor growth inhibition activity. The results indicated that the most promising conjugate was the compound in which Dau was connected to the side chain of Lys (Ac-SYSNleEHFRWGK(Dau=Aoa)PV-NH2). The highest cellular uptake by melanoma cells was demonstrated using the compound, with the highest tumor growth inhibition detected both on mouse (38.6% on B16) and human uveal melanoma (55% on OMC-1) cells. The effect of the compound was more pronounced than that of the free drug.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816934', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021095', 'CorpusId': 267093683, 'PubMed': '38256168'}",1,"Given that malignant melanoma is highly aggressive and resistant to conventional chemotherapy, resulting in a significantly low 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic disease, there is a critical need for more effective treatments.

One identified mechanism underlying CIPN is neuroinflammation. Most of this research has been conducted in only male or female rodent models, making direct comparisons regarding the role of sex differences in the neuroimmune underpinnings of CIPN limited. Moreover, most measurements have focused on the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and/or spinal cord, while relatively few studies have been aimed at characterizing neuroinflammation in the brain, for example the periaqueductal grey (PAG). The overall goals of the present study were to determine (1) paclitaxel-associated changes in markers of inflammation in the PAG and DRG in male and female C57Bl6 mice and (2) determine the effect of prophylactic administration of an anti-inflammatory cannabinoid, cannabigerol (CBG). In Experiment 1, male and female mice were treated with paclitaxel (8–32 mg/kg/injection, Days 1, 3, 5, and 7) and mechanical sensitivity was measured using Von Frey filaments on Day 7 (Cohort 1) and Day 14 (Cohort 2). Cohorts were euthanized on Day 8 or 15, respectively, and DRG and PAG were harvested for qPCR analysis of the gene expression of markers of pain and inflammation Aig1, Gfap, Ccl2, Cxcl9, Tlr4, Il6, and Calca. In Experiment 2, male and female mice were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg CBG i.p. 30 min prior to each paclitaxel injection. Mechanical sensitivity was measured on Day 14. Mice were euthanized on Day 15, and PAG were harvested for qPCR analysis of the gene expression of Aig1, Gfap, Ccl2, Cxcl9, Tlr4, Il6, and Calca. Paclitaxel produced a transient increase in potency to produce mechanical sensitivity in male versus female mice. Regarding neuroinflammation, more gene expression changes were apparent earlier in the DRG and at a later time point in the PAG. Also, more changes were observed in females in the PAG than males. Overall, sex differences were observed for most markers at both time points and regions. Importantly, in both the DRG and PAG, most increases in markers of neuroinflammation and pain occurred at paclitaxel doses higher than those associated with significant changes in the mechanical threshold. Two analytes that demonstrated the most compelling sexual dimorphism and that changed more in males were Cxcl9 and Ccl2, and Tlr4 in females. Lastly, prophylactic administration of CBG protected the male and female mice from increased mechanical sensitivity and female mice from neuroinflammation in the PAG. Future studies are warranted to explore how these sex differences may shed light on the mechanisms of CIPN and how non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as CBG may engage these targets to prevent or attenuate the effects of paclitaxel and other chemotherapeutic agents on the nervous system.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050247', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084277', 'CorpusId': 269130955, 'PubMed': '38673862'}",1,"Given that chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major complication limiting chemotherapy efficacy, and neuroinflammation is a key mechanism, this study explored sex differences in neuroinflammatory responses in both the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and brain regions such as the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in male and female mice treated with paclitaxel. The research found notable sex-specific changes in gene expression related to pain and inflammation, with distinct temporal patterns in the DRG and PAG. Additionally, prophylactic treatment with the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid, cannabigerol (CBG), effectively mitigated mechanical sensitivity and neuroinflammation, particularly in female mice.

We analyzed the HLA alleles at the -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci in a cohort of 130 individuals with severe and extremely severe forms of COVID-19, including 44 individuals who died. We compared these findings to a control group consisting of individuals who had either not been diagnosed with COVID-19 or had experienced mild forms of the disease. Using multivariate logistic regression models, we discovered that the B*27 and B*50 alleles were associated with an increased susceptibility to developing a severe form of COVID-19. The A*33 and C*15 alleles showed potential for offering protection against the disease. Furthermore, we identified two protective alleles (A*03 and DQB1*02) against the development of extremely severe forms of COVID-19.

Living bacteria often deal with carbon monoxide (CO) which can act as both a signaling molecule and a poison. Bacterial terminal oxidases contain hemes; therefore, they are potential targets for CO. However, our knowledge of this issue is limited and contradictory. Here, we investigated the effect of CO on the cell growth and aerobic respiration of three different Escherichia coli mutants, each expressing only one terminal quinol oxidase: cytochrome bd-I, cytochrome bd-II, or cytochrome bo3. We found that following the addition of CO to bd-I-only cells, a minimal effect on growth was observed, whereas the growth of both bd-II-only and bo3-only strains was severely impaired. Consistently, the degree of resistance of aerobic respiration of bd-I-only cells to CO is high, as opposed to high CO sensitivity displayed by bd-II-only and bo3-only cells consuming O2. Such a difference between the oxidases in sensitivity to CO was also observed with isolated membranes of the mutants. Accordingly, O2 consumption of wild-type cells showed relatively low CO sensitivity under conditions favoring the expression of a bd-type oxidase.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10815991', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021277', 'CorpusId': 267146873, 'PubMed': '38279276'}",1,"Given that terminal oxidases in bacterial aerobic respiratory chains are crucial for energy production and can be targeted by carbon monoxide (CO), a molecule that acts both as a signaling agent and a toxicant, we propose to investigate the differential sensitivity of bacterial terminal oxidases to CO.

This differential sensitivity impacts both cell growth and aerobic respiration, suggesting that cytochrome bd-I provides a protective mechanism against CO toxicity. The findings indicate a potential avenue for developing strategies to mitigate CO poisoning by targeting specific oxidases."

The high diversity of plant morphology in this genus poses significant challenges for species identification, given their propensity for highland dwelling, which makes it a question worth exploring how they cope with the harsh surroundings. In this study, we recently generated chloroplast (cp) genomes of two Meconopsis species, Meconopsis paniculata (M. paniculata) and M. pinnatifolia, and compared them with those of ten Meconopsis cp genomes to comprehend cp genomic features, their phylogenetic relationships, and what part they might play in plateau adaptation. These cp genomes shared a great deal of similarities in terms of genome size, structure, gene content, GC content, and codon usage patterns. The cp genomes were between 151,864 bp and 154,997 bp in length, and contain 133 predictive genes. Through sequence divergence analysis, we identified three highly variable regions (trnD-psbD, ccsA-ndhD, and ycf1 genes), which could be used as potential markers or DNA barcodes for phylogenetic analysis. Between 22 and 38 SSRs and some long repeat sequences were identified from 12 Meconopsis species. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed that 12 species of Meconopsis clustered into a monophyletic clade in Papaveraceae, which corroborated their intrageneric relationships. The results indicated that M. pinnatifolia and M. paniculata are sister species in the phylogenetic tree. In addition, the atpA and ycf2 genes were positively selected in high-altitude species.

The conserved activation complex MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW; MYB: v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog; bHLH: basic helix–loop–helix protein; WD40:WD-repeat protein) involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis has been thoroughly researched, but there have been limited investigations into the function of repressor factors. In this study, we characterized TgMYB4, an R2R3-MYB transcriptional repressor which is highly expressed during petal coloration in red petal cultivars. TgMYB4-overexpressing tobaccos exhibited white or light pink petals with less anthocyanin accumulation compared to control plants. TgMYB4 was found to inhibit the transcription of ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (TfANS1) and DIHYDRO-FLAVONOL-4-REDUCTASE (AtDFR), although it did not bind to their promoters. Moreover, the TgMYB4 protein was able to compete with the MYB activator to bind to the :bHLHprotein, thereby suppressing the function of the activator MBW complex.

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has been shown to decrease body weight and adiposity and improve metabolic outcomes; however, the effect of TRF on NASH has not yet been fully understood. We had previously reported that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) mediates hepatic insulin signaling. Importantly, we have found that TRF increases hepatic IPMK levels. Therefore, we investigated whether there is a causal link between TRF and IPMK in a mouse model of NASH, i.e., methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD)-induced steatohepatitis. Here, we show that TRF alleviated markers of NASH, i.e., reduced hepatic steatosis, liver triglycerides (TG), serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), inflammation, and fibrosis in MCDD mice. Interestingly, MCDD led to a significant reduction in IPMK levels, and the deletion of hepatic IPMK exacerbates the NASH phenotype induced by MCDD, accompanied by increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines. Conversely, TRF restored IPMK levels and significantly reduced gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Our results demonstrate that TRF attenuates MCDD-induced NASH via IPMK-mediated changes in hepatic steatosis and inflammation.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855189', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031390', 'CorpusId': 267236313, 'PubMed': '38338668'}",1,"Given that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with significant health implications, the potential therapeutic effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF) on NASH remain unclear.

The findings suggest that TRF significantly alleviates markers of NASH, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, in a mouse model. Importantly, TRF appears to restore IPMK levels, which are otherwise diminished in NASH conditions, thereby reducing pro-inflammatory responses. These results propose that TRF could be a viable strategy to counteract NASH by leveraging IPMK-mediated pathways."

The probiotic Lact. rhamnosus 1.5 (3.1 × 108 CFU/mL, derived from raw buffalo milk) was administered by gavage three times a week. Probiotic supplementation provided an anxiolytic effect in CONT and HFD. The IL-6 showed lower levels after probiotic supplementation in the HFD. Regarding immunoreactivity for GFAP in the cerebral cortex, we demonstrated that animals HFD-fed had a reduction in cells number compared to CONT. In the hippocampus, we found an interaction between diet and supplementation, as well as an effect of probiotic supplementation.

The chronic comorbidities concomitant with repetitive mTBI (rmTBI) include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or neurological dysfunction. This study sought to determine a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression signature in serum samples that correlated with rmTBI years after the incidences. Serum samples were obtained from Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain-Injury Consortium Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (LIMBIC CENC) repository, from participants unexposed to TBI or who had rmTBI. Four lncRNAs were identified as consistently present in all samples, as detected via droplet digital PCR and packaged in exosomes enriched for CNS origin. The results, using qPCR, demonstrated that the lncRNA VLDLR-AS1 levels were significantly lower among individuals with rmTBI compared to those with no lifetime TBI. ROC analysis determined an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.6124 to 0.8741; p = 0.0012). The optimal cutoff for VLDLR-AS1 was ≤153.8 ng. A secondary analysis of clinical data from LIMBIC CENC was conducted to evaluate the psychological symptom burden, and the results show that lncRNAs VLDLR-AS1 and MALAT1 are correlated with symptoms of depression.

The bacterial two-hybrid system, based on the reconstitution in the E. coli cytoplasm of the adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis, should provide a relatively faster and presumably more physiological assay for cyanobacterial proteins than the yeast system. Here, we used the bacterial two-hybrid system to gain additional insights into the cyanobacterial PipX interaction network while simultaneously assessing the advantages and limitations of the two most popular two-hybrid systems. A comprehensive mutational analysis of PipX and bacterial two-hybrid assays were performed to compare the outcomes between yeast and bacterial systems. We detected interactions that were previously recorded in the yeast two-hybrid system as negative, as well as a “false positive”, the self-interaction of PipX, which is rather an indirect interaction that is dependent on PII homologues from the E. coli host, a result confirmed by Western blot analysis with relevant PipX variants.

Co-treatment with recombinant S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) enabled increased adherence to glycemic targets with half as much insulin and without causing hypoglycemia. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the hyperglycemia-suppressing action of S100A9 is due to a Toll-like receptor 4–dependent increase in glucose uptake in specific skeletal muscles (i.e., soleus and diaphragm). In addition, we found that T1DM mice have abnormal systemic inflammation, which is resolved by S100A9 therapy alone (or in combination with low insulin), hence uncovering a potent anti-inflammatory action of S100A9 in T1DM.

However, the causal effects of mineral nutrients on gut microbiota and their causal associations with diseases remain unclear and require further investigation. This study aimed to identify the associations between serum mineral nutrients, gut microbiota, and risk of neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). We conducted an MR study using the large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 5 serum mineral nutrients, 196 gut microbes at the phylum, order, family, and genus levels, and a variety of common neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic diseases. Initially, the independent causal associations of mineral nutrients and gut microbiota with diseases were examined by MR. Subsequently, the causal effect of mineral nutrients on gut microbiota was estimated to investigate whether specific gut microbes mediated the association between mineral nutrients and diseases. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the study results. After correcting for multiple testing, we identified a total of 33 causal relationships among mineral nutrients, gut microbiota, and diseases.

However, the comprehensive exploration of tocotrienol’s hypolipidemic impact and the corresponding mechanisms in aquatic species remains inadequate. In this study, we established a zebrafish model of a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model through high-fat diet administration to zebrafish. In the T2DM zebrafish, the thickness of ocular vascular walls significantly increased compared to the control group, which was mitigated after treatment with T3. Additionally, our findings demonstrate the regulatory effect of T3 on lipid metabolism, leading to the reduced synthesis and storage of adipose tissue in zebrafish. We validated the expression patterns of genes relevant to these processes using RT-qPCR. In the T2DM model, there was an almost two-fold upregulation in pparγ and cyp7a1 mRNA levels, coupled with a significant downregulation in cpt1a mRNA (p < 0.01) compared to the control group. The ELISA revealed that the protein expression levels of Pparγ and Rxrα exhibited a two-fold elevation in the T2DM group relative to the control. In the T3-treated group, Pparγ and Rxrα protein expression levels consistently exhibited a two-fold decrease compared to the model group. Lipid metabolomics showed that T3 could affect the metabolic pathways of zebrafish lipid regulation, including lipid synthesis and decomposition. We provided experimental evidence that T3 could mitigate lipid accumulation in our zebrafish T2DM model.

This makes them an ideal option for addressing skin aging and diseases. This study aimed to assess the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of cherry stem extract for potential skincare use. To this end, the extract was first comprehensively characterized by HPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS. The extract’s total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity, radical scavenging efficiency, and its ability to inhibit enzymes related to skin aging were determined. A total of 146 compounds were annotated in the cherry stem extract. The extract effectively fought against NO· and HOCl radicals with IC50 values of 2.32 and 5.4 mg/L. Additionally, it inhibited HYALase, collagenase, and XOD enzymes with IC50 values of 7.39, 111.92, and 10 mg/L, respectively. Based on the promising results that were obtained, the extract was subsequently gently integrated into a cosmetic gel at different concentrations and subjected to further stability evaluations. The accelerated stability was assessed through temperature ramping, heating-cooling cycles, and centrifugation, while the long-term stability was evaluated by storing the formulations under light and dark conditions for three months.

Previous research suggests an association between mood disorders and P2RX7 gene encoding P2X7 receptors, which stimulate neuroinflammation. We investigated the effect of P2RX7 variation in interaction with early childhood adversities and traumas and recent stressors on lifetime suicide attempts and current suicide risk markers. Overall, 1644 participants completed questionnaires assessing childhood adversities, recent negative life events, and provided information about previous suicide attempts and current suicide risk-related markers, including thoughts of ending their life, death, and hopelessness. Subjects were genotyped for 681 SNPs in the P2RX7 gene, 335 of which passed quality control and were entered into logistic and linear regression models, followed by a clumping procedure to identify clumps of SNPs with a significant main and interaction effect. We identified two significant clumps with a main effect on current suicidal ideation with top SNPs rs641940 and rs1653613. In interaction with childhood trauma, we identified a clump with top SNP psy_rs11615992 and another clump on hopelessness containing rs78473339 as index SNP.

We show that a particular form of tonic cannabinoid signaling is essential for setting target cell–dependent synaptic variability. It does not require the activity of the two major endocannabinoid-producing enzymes. Instead, by developing a workflow for physiological, anatomical, and molecular measurements at the same unitary synapse, we demonstrate that the nanoscale stoichiometric ratio of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) to the release machinery is sufficient to predict synapse-specific release probability. Accordingly, selective decrease of extrasynaptic CB1Rs does not affect synaptic transmission, whereas in vivo exposure to the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol disrupts the intrasynaptic nanoscale stoichiometry and reduces synaptic variability. These findings imply that synapses leverage the nanoscale stoichiometry of presynaptic receptor coupling to the release machinery to establish synaptic strength in a target cell–dependent manner.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11135421', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.ado0077', 'CorpusId': 270119531, 'PubMed': '38809980'}",1,"Given that the nanoscale stoichiometric ratio of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) to the release machinery at synapses is a key predictor of synapse-specific release probability, our research proposes to investigate how alterations in CB1R stoichiometry influence synaptic variability and strength in different neural circuits.

The most widely used method to generate such a model is collagenase injection, although this method possesses limitations. We developed an optimized rat model of patellar tendinopathy via the ultrasound-guided injection of collagenase mixed with a thermo-responsive Pluronic hydrogel into the patellar tendon of sixty male Wistar rats. All analyses were carried out at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-injury. We confirmed that our rat model reproduced the pathophysiology observed in human patients through analyses of ultrasonography, histology, immunofluorescence, and biomechanical parameters. Tendons that were injured by the injection of the collagenase–Pluronic mixture exhibited a significant increase in the cross-sectional area (p < 0.01), a high degree of tissue disorganization and hypercellularity, significantly strong neovascularization (p < 0.01), important changes in the levels of types I and III collagen expression, and the organization and presence of intra-tendinous calcifications. Decreases in the maximum rupture force and stiffness were also observed. These results demonstrate that our model replicates the key features observed in human patellar tendinopathy.

First, cancer cells secrete exosomes to program quiescent fibroblasts into activated CAFs. Second, cancer cells maintain the CAF phenotype via activation of signal transduction pathways. We rationalized that inhibiting this two-step process can normalize CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts and augment the efficacy of immunotherapy. We show that cancer cell–targeted nanoliposomes that inhibit sequential steps of exosome biogenesis and release from lung cancer cells block the differentiation of lung fibroblasts into CAFs. In parallel, we demonstrate that CAF-targeted nanoliposomes that block two distinct nodes in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)–Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can reverse activate CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts. Co-administration of both nanoliposomes significantly improves the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and enhances the antitumor efficacy of αPD-L1 in immunocompetent lung cancer–bearing mice.

Clot-forming dysfunction might be responsible for venous thrombosis in PEX. We investigated global coagulation, the proteome, and functions of platelets in PEX patients and aimed to determine prognostic biomarkers for thrombosis risk in PEX. Peripheral blood was collected from PEX and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) patients, and age–sex matched controls. Viscoelastic hemostasis was evaluated by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Platelet markers (CD41, CD42, CD61, and CD62p) and endothelial markers (P-selectin, E-selectin, and von Willebrand factor) were investigated by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. The platelet proteome was analyzed by 2D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. Clot formation time (CFT) is significantly reduced in PEX patients compared to the controls (p < 0.05). P-selectin levels were higher in PEX patients than in controls (p < 0.05); E-selectin and von Willebrand factor remained unchanged. The monitorization of CFT by ROTEM, and soluble P-selectin, may help assess thrombotic risk in PEX patients. Proteomic analysis revealed differential expression of Profilin-1 in platelets.

Recent data retrieved in tumor and stem cells demonstrated that p53 also carries out non-canonical functions when interacting with the translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase iota (POLι) at DNA replication forks. This protein complex triggers a DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanism controlling the DNA replication rate. Given that the levels of p53 trigger non-binary rheostat-like functions in response to stress or during differentiation, we explore the relevance of the p53 levels for its DDT functions at the fork. We show that subtle changes in p53 levels modulate the contribution of some DDT factors including POLι, POLη, POLζ, REV1, PCNA, PRIMPOL, HLTF and ZRANB3 to the DNA replication rate. Our results suggest that the levels of p53 are central to coordinate the balance between DDT pathways including (i) fork-deceleration by the ZRANB3-mediated fork reversal factor, (ii) POLι-p53-mediated fork-slowing, (iii) POLι- and POLη-mediated TLS and (iv) PRIMPOL-mediated fork-acceleration.

HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) invade the brain of these individuals, promoting neurotoxicity. We demonstrated an increased expression of cathepsin B (CATB), a lysosomal protease, in monocytes and post-mortem brain tissues of women with HAND. Increased CATB release from HIV-infected MDM leads to neurotoxicity, and their secretion is associated with NF-κB activation, oxidative stress, and lysosomal exocytosis. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) agonist, JWH-133, decreases HIV-1 replication, CATB secretion, and neurotoxicity from HIV-infected MDM, but the mechanisms are not entirely understood. We hypothesized that HIV-1 infection upregulates the expression of proteins associated with oxidative stress and that a CB2R agonist could reverse these effects. MDM were isolated from healthy women donors (n = 3), infected with HIV-1ADA, and treated with JWH-133. After 13 days post-infection, cell lysates were labeled by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) and analyzed by LC/MS/MS quantitative proteomics bioinformatics. While HIV-1 infection upregulated CATB, NF-κB signaling, Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, and lysosomal exocytosis, JWH-133 treatment downregulated the expression of the proteins involved in these pathways.

A promising approach to AD prevention is the reduction of free Aβ levels by directed enhancement of Aβ binding to its natural depot, human serum albumin (HSA). We previously demonstrated the ability of specific low-molecular-weight ligands (LMWLs) in HSA to improve its affinity for Aβ. Here we develop this approach through a bioinformatic search for the clinically approved AD-related LMWLs in HSA, followed by classification of the candidates according to the predicted location of their binding sites on the HSA surface, ranking of the candidates, and selective experimental validation of their impact on HSA affinity for Aβ. The top 100 candidate LMWLs were classified into five clusters. The specific representatives of the different clusters exhibit dramatically different behavior, with 3- to 13-fold changes in equilibrium dissociation constants for the HSA–Aβ40 interaction: prednisone favors HSA–Aβ interaction, mefenamic acid shows the opposite effect, and levothyroxine exhibits bidirectional effects.

In doing so, the study sought to delineate the role of self-efficacy as a key mediator in the intricate relationship between the resilience of cadets and their professional achievements. The main focus of this study was to clarify the causal and effect relationships between the psychology and behavior mechanisms of the cadets. This was achieved through rigorous scrutiny of the moderated mediating effect of vocational calling within the multifaceted relationship involving cadets’ resilience, self-efficacy, and professional achievement. Methods The study’s participant pool consisted of 121 individuals, comprising cadets in their third and fourth years of study, all of whom aspired to attain the rank of officer within the Military Academy. To rigorously investigate the hypotheses presented, a series of causal relationships among the four core variables were evaluated using a robust regression analysis methodology. To facilitate this analysis, the PROCESS macro 3.5v, a Hayes-developed tool, was effectively used. Results The findings of this study revealed several critical insights. First, vocational calling emerged as a potent moderating factor in shaping the relationship between cadets’ resilience and self-efficacy. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that vocational calling exerted a conditional influence on the impact of cadets’ resilience on their professional achievement, with self-efficacy serving as a crucial mediating mechanism in this relationship. In particular, the study affirmed that self-efficacy functioned as a comprehensive mediator, elucidating the pathway through which the resilience of the cadets ultimately influenced their professional achievements. Conclusion The results of this research contribute significantly to enhancing our understanding of the intricate connection between the resilience levels exhibited by cadets and their corresponding professional achievements.

Several oncolytic Human AdenoViruses (HAdVs) have been reported to re-sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells and in combination with chemotherapeutics attenuate solid tumour growth. Obstacles preventing greater clinical success are rapid hepatic elimination and limited viral replication and spread within the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesised that higher intratumoural levels of the virus could be achieved by altering cellular epigenetic regulation. Here we report on the screening of an enriched epigenetics small molecule library and validation of six compounds that increased viral gene expression and replication. The greatest effects were observed with three epigenetic inhibitors targeting bromodomain (BRD)-containing proteins. Specifically, BRD4 inhibitors enhanced the efficacy of Ad5 wild type, Ad∆∆, and Ad-3∆-A20T in 3-dimensional co-culture models of PDAC and in vivo xenografts. RNAseq analysis demonstrated that the inhibitors increased viral E1A expression, altered expression of cell cycle regulators and inflammatory factors, and attenuated expression levels of tumour cell oncogenes such as c-Myc and Myb. The data suggest that the tumour-selective Ad∆∆ and Ad-3∆-A20T combined with epigenetic inhibitors is a novel strategy for the treatment of PDAC by eliminating both cancer and associated stromal cells to pave the way for immune cell access even after systemic delivery of the virus.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816486', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021265', 'CorpusId': 267055516, 'PubMed': '38279262'}",1,"Given that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notoriously resistant to conventional treatments, our research proposes leveraging oncolytic Human AdenoViruses (HAdVs) in combination with epigenetic inhibitors to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

This combination not only improved the efficacy of various HAdV strains in 3D co-culture models and in vivo xenografts but also modulated key regulatory pathways and oncogenes, facilitating immune cell access to the tumor. This novel strategy suggests a promising avenue for overcoming resistance in PDAC treatment by targeting both cancer cells and the supportive stromal environment."

In this study, four pairs of human lenses from age-matched male and female donors and one pair of male lenses ranging in age from 64 to 73 years old (yo) were obtained to investigate the interactions of α-crystallin with the NM and CM throughout the progression of cortical cataract (CC) and nuclear cataract (NC) using the electron paramagnetic resonance spin-labeling method. Donor health history information (diabetes, smoker, hypertension, radiation treatment), sex, and race were included in the data analysis. The right eye lenses CM and NM investigated were 64 yo male (CC: 0), 68 yo male (CC: 3, NC: 2), 73 yo male (CC: 1, NC: 2), 68 yo female (CC: 3, NC: 2), and 73 yo female (CC: 1, NC: 3). Similarly, left eye lenses CM and NM investigated were 64 yo male (CC: 0), 68 yo male (CC: 3, NC: 2), 73 yo male (CC: 2, NC: 3), 68 yo female (CC: 3, NC: 2), and 73 yo female (CC: 1, NC: 3). Analysis of α-crystallin binding to male and female eye lens CM and NM revealed that the percentage of membrane surface occupied (MSO) by α-crystallin increases with increasing grade of CC and NC. The binding of α-crystallin resulted in decreased mobility, increased order, and increased hydrophobicity on the membrane surface in male and female eye lens CM and NM. CM mobility decreased with an increase in cataracts for both males and females, whereas the male lens NM mobility showed no significant change, while female lens NM showed increased mobility with an increase in cataract grade. Our data shows that a 68 yo female donor (long-term smoker, pre-diabetic, and hypertension; grade 3 CC) showed the largest MSO by α-crystallin in CM from both the left and right lens and had the most pronounced mobility changes relative to all other analyzed samples. The variation in cholesterol (Chol) content, size and amount of cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs), and lipid composition in the CM and NM with age and cataract might result in a variation of membrane surface mobility, membrane surface hydrophobicity, and the interactions of α-crystallin at the surface of each CM and NM. These findings provide insight into the effect of decreased Chol content and the reduced size and amount of CBDs in the cataractous CM and NM with an increased binding of α-crystallin with increased CC and NC grade, which suggests that Chol and CBDs might be a key component in maintaining lens transparency.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855980', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031936', 'CorpusId': 267505781, 'PubMed': '38339214'}",1,"Given that eye lens α-crystallin becomes increasingly membrane-bound with age and cataract formation, this study investigates its interactions with cortical membrane (CM) and nuclear membrane (NM) in human lenses.

Neutrophils can generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Uncontrolled NET-formation or impaired NET-clearance evidently cause tissue and organ damage resulting in immune-mediated diseases. The aim of the study was to verify that NET-formation is detectable in ex vivo samples of acute diseased dogs with SRMA by visualizing and measuring NET-markers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. CSF-samples of dogs with acute SRMA (n = 5) and in remission (n = 4) were examined using immunofluorescence (IF)-staining of DNA-histone-1-complexes, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated Histone H3 (H3Cit). Immunogold-labeling of H3Cit and neutrophil elastase followed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to determine ultrastructural NET-formation in the CSF of one exemplary dog. H3Cit-levels and DNase-activity were measured in CSF and serum samples using an H3Cit-ELISA and a DNase-activity-assay, respectively in patients with the following diseases: acute SRMA (n = 34), SRMA in remission (n = 4), bacterial encephalitis (n = 3), meningioma with neutrophilic inflammation (n = 4), healthy dogs (n = 6). NET-formation was detectable with IF-staining in n = 3/5 CSF samples of dogs with acute SRMA but were not detectable during remission. Vesicular NET-formation was detectable in one exemplary dog using TEM. DNase-activity was significantly reduced in dogs suffering from acute SRMA compared to healthy control group (p < 0.0001). There were no statistical differences of H3Cit levels in CSF or serum samples of acute diseased dogs compared to dogs under treatment, dogs suffering from meningioma or bacterial encephalitis or the healthy control group. Our findings demonstrate that NET-formation and insufficient NET-clearance possibly drive the immunologic dysregulation and complement the pathogenesis of SRMA. The detection of NETs in SRMA offers many possibilities to explore the aetiopathogenetic influence of this defence mechanism of the innate immune system in infectious and non-infectious canine neuropathies.",2024,PLoS ONE,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10798544', 'DOI': '10.1371/journal.pone.0295268', 'CorpusId': 267050327, 'PubMed': '38241272'}",1,"Given that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and impaired NET clearance are implicated in tissue and organ damage leading to immune-mediated diseases, this study aimed to investigate the presence and role of NETs in steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis (SRMA) in dogs.

The effects of intracellular IL-1α on the development of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in mice were assessed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to suppress IL-1α expression in 4T1 breast cancer cells. Knockout of IL-1α in 4T1 cells modified expression of multiple genes, including downregulation of cytokines and chemokines involved in the recruitment of tumor-associated pro-inflammatory cells. Orthotopical injection of IL-1α knockout (KO) 4T1 cells into BALB/c mice led to a significant decrease in local tumor growth and lung metastases, compared to injection of wild-type 4T1 (4T1/WT) cells. Neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells were abundant in tumors developing after injection of 4T1/WT cells, whereas more antigen-presenting cells were observed in the tumor microenvironment after injection of IL-1α KO 4T1 cells. This switch correlated with increased infiltration of CD3+CD8+ and NKp46+cells. Engraftment of IL-1α knockout 4T1 cells into immunodeficient NOD.SCID mice resulted in more rapid tumor growth, with increased lung metastasis in comparison to engraftment of 4T1/WT cells.

Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to suppress IL-1α in 4T1 breast cancer cells in mice, we observed significant changes in gene expression, particularly a reduction in cytokines and chemokines that recruit pro-inflammatory cells. This suppression led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis, with a shift from an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to one enriched with antigen-presenting and cytotoxic cells. Interestingly, in immunodeficient mice, the absence of IL-1α resulted in accelerated tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting a complex role for IL-1α in tumor-immune interactions. These findings propose that modulating IL-1α could be a viable strategy to influence tumor progression and the immune landscape in TNBC."

Aux/IAA is the early auxin-responsive gene that participates in regulating plant morphogenesis such as apical dominance, stem elongation, lateral branch development, and lateral root formation. However, no studies have investigated the response of the Aux/IAA gene family to phytoplasma infection in Paulownia fortunei. In this study, a total of 62 Aux/IAA genes were found in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PfAux/IAA genes could be divided into eight subgroups, which were formed by tandem duplication and fragment replication. Most of them had a simple gene structure, and several members lacked one or two conserved domains. By combining the expression of PfAux/IAA genes under phytoplasma stress and SA-treated phytoplasma-infected seedlings, we found that PfAux/IAA13/33/45 may play a vital role in the occurrence of PaWB. Functional analysis based on homologous relationships showed a strong correlation between PfAux/IAA45 and branching. Protein–protein interaction prediction showed that PfARF might be the binding partner of PfAux/IAA, and the yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescent complementary assay confirmed the interaction of PfAux/IAA45 and PfARF13.

While recent progress has been made in understanding the biological roles of m5C, the inability to introduce m5C at specific sites within transcripts has hindered efforts to elucidate direct links between specific m5C and phenotypic outcomes. Here, we developed a CRISPR–Cas13d-based tool, named reengineered m5C modification system (termed ‘RCMS’), for targeted m5C methylation and demethylation in specific transcripts. The RCMS editors consist of a nuclear-localized dCasRx conjugated to either a methyltransferase, NSUN2/NSUN6, or a demethylase, the catalytic domain of mouse Tet2 (ten–eleven translocation 2), enabling the manipulation of methylation events at precise m5C sites. We demonstrate that the RCMS editors can direct site-specific m5C incorporation and demethylation. Furthermore, we confirm their effectiveness in modulating m5C levels within transfer RNAs and their ability to induce changes in transcript abundance and cell proliferation through m5C-mediated mechanisms. These findings collectively establish RCMS editors as a focused epitranscriptome engineering tool, facilitating the identification of individual m5C alterations and their consequential effects.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11014266', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae110', 'CorpusId': 267721240, 'PubMed': '38366553'}",1,"Given that 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is a critical RNA modification involved in regulating RNA fate and gene expression, the development of a targeted tool to manipulate m5C sites could significantly advance our understanding of its specific functional roles.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have a potential therapeutic role for some cancers. HDAC inhibitors affect the expression of both CGN and FOXO1. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of CGN and FOXO1 are unknown in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal human lung epithelial (HLE) cells. In the present study, to investigate the effects of CGN and FOXO1 on the malignancy of NSCLC, we used A549 cells as human lung adenocarcinoma and primary human lung epithelial (HLE) cells as normal lung tissues and performed the knockdown of CGN and FOXO1 by siRNAs. Furthermore, to investigate the detailed mechanisms in the antitumor effects of HDAC inhibitors for NSCLC via CGN and FOXO1, A549 cells and HLE cells were treated with the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and Quisinostat (JNJ-2648158). In A549 cells, the knockdown of CGN increased bicellular TJ protein claudin-2 (CLDN-2) via mitogen-activated protein kinase/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (MAPK/AMPK) pathways and induced cell migration, while the knockdown of FOXO1 increased claudin-4 (CLDN-4), decreased CGN, and induced cell proliferation. The knockdown of CGN and FOXO1 induced cell metabolism in A549 cells. TSA and Quisinostat increased CGN and tricellular TJ protein angulin-1/lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) in A549. In normal HLE cells, the knockdown of CGN and FOXO1 increased CLDN-4, while HDAC inhibitors increased CGN and CLDN-4. In conclusion, the knockdown of CGN via FOXO1 contributes to the malignancy of NSCLC.

The rate of root growth, the density of lateral roots, and the spatial structure of lateral and adventitious roots determine the developmental plasticity of the root system in response to changes in environmental conditions. One of the genes involved in the regulation of the slope angle of lateral roots is DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1). Its orthologs and paralogs have been identified in rice, Arabidopsis, and several other species. However, nothing is known about the formation of the slope angle of lateral roots in species with the initiation of lateral root primordia within the parental root meristem. To address this knowledge gap, we identified orthologs and paralogs of the DRO1 gene in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) using a phylogenetic analysis of IGT protein family members. Differences in the transcriptional response of CsDRO1, CsDRO1-LIKE1 (CsDRO1L1), and CsDRO1-LIKE2 (CsDRO1L2) to exogenous auxin were analyzed. The results showed that only CsDRO1L1 is auxin-responsive. An analysis of promoter–reporter fusions demonstrated that the CsDRO1, CsDRO1L1, and CsDRO1L2 genes were expressed in the meristem in cell files of the central cylinder, endodermis, and cortex; the three genes displayed different expression patterns in cucumber roots with only partial overlap.

So far, although few wheat heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) have been found to be involved in the stress response, the biological functions of them, especially the members of the HsfC (heat shock transcription factor C) subclass, remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a class C encoding gene, TaHsfC3-4, based on our previous omics data and analyzed its biological function in transgenic plants. TaHsfC3-4 encodes a protein containing 274 amino acids and shows the basic characteristics of the HsfC class. Gene expression profiles revealed that TaHsfC3-4 was constitutively expressed in many tissues of wheat and was induced during seed maturation. TaHsfC3-4 could be upregulated by PEG and abscisic acid (ABA), suggesting that this Hsf may be involved in the regulation pathway depending on ABA in drought resistance. Further results represented that TaHsfC3-4 was localized in the nucleus but had no transcriptional activation activity. Notably, overexpression of TaHsfC3-4 in Arabidopsis thaliana pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl4 (pyr1pyl124) quadruple mutant plants complemented the ABA-hyposensitive phenotypes of the quadruple mutant including cotyledon greening, root elongation, seedling growth, and increased tolerance to drought, indicating positive roles of TaHsfC3-4 in the ABA signaling pathway and drought tolerance. Furthermore, we identified TaHsfA2-11 as a TaHsfC3-4-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening. The experimental data show that TaHsfC3-4 can indeed interact with TaHsfA2-11 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis TaHsfA2-11 overexpression lines exhibited enhanced drought tolerance, too. In summary, our study confirmed the role of TaHsfC3-4 in response to drought stress and provided a target locus for marker-assisted selection breeding to improve drought tolerance in wheat.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816066', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25020977', 'CorpusId': 267093922, 'PubMed': '38256051'}",1,"Given that drought stress significantly hampers wheat yield and quality, our research seeks to explore the role of heat shock transcription factors, specifically the HsfC subclass, in enhancing drought resistance.

Cellular hypoxia can confer radioresistance through cellular and tumor micro-environment adaptations. Until recently, studies evaluating radioresistance secondary to hypoxia were designed to maintain cellular hypoxia only before and during irradiation, while any handling of post-irradiated cells was carried out in standard oxic conditions due to the unavailability of hypoxia workstations. This limited the possibility of simulating in vivo or clinical conditions in vitro. The presence of molecular oxygen is more important for the radiotoxicity of low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation (e.g., X-rays) than that of high-LET carbon (12C) ions. The mechanisms responsible for 12C ions’ potential to overcome hypoxia-induced radioresistance are currently not fully understood. Therefore, the radioresistance of hypoxic A549 NSCLC cells following exposure to X-rays or 12C ions was investigated along with cell cycle progression and gene expression by maintaining hypoxia before, during and after irradiation. A549 cells were incubated under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 48 h and then irradiated with X-rays (200 kV) or 12C ions (35 MeV/n, LET ~75 keV/µm). Cell survival was evaluated using colony-forming ability (CFA) assays immediately or 24 h after irradiation (late plating). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed using γH2AX immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometry of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells. The global transcription profile post-irradiation was evaluated by RNA sequencing. When hypoxia was maintained before, during and after irradiation, hypoxia-induced radioresistance was observed only in late plating CFA experiments. The killing efficiency of 12C ions was much higher than that of X-rays. Cell survival under hypoxia was affected more strongly by the timepoint of plating in the case of X-rays compared to 12C ions. Cell cycle arrest following irradiation under hypoxia was less pronounced but more prolonged. DSB induction and resolution following irradiation were not significantly different under normoxia and hypoxia. Gene expression response to irradiation primarily comprised cell cycle regulation for both radiation qualities and oxygen conditions. Several PI3K target genes involved in cell migration and cell motility were differentially upregulated in hypoxic cells. Hypoxia-induced radioresistance may be linked to altered cell cycle response to irradiation and PI3K-mediated changes in cell motility and migration in A549 cells rather than less DNA damage or faster repair.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816011', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021010', 'CorpusId': 267092074, 'PubMed': '38256084'}",1,"Given that hypoxia-induced radioresistance significantly compromises the efficacy of radiotherapy for solid tumors like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), our research aims to explore the differential impacts of low-linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays and high-LET carbon (12C) ions on hypoxic A549 NSCLC cells. The study maintained hypoxic conditions before, during, and after irradiation, simulating more clinically relevant scenarios. Findings indicate that while both types of radiation affect cell survival, 12C ions exhibit a higher killing efficiency under hypoxia compared to X-rays. Additionally, the radioresistance observed under hypoxia appears linked to changes in cell cycle progression and PI3K-mediated alterations in cell motility and migration, rather than differences in DNA damage induction or repair. This suggests that targeting these cellular responses could enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy in hypoxic tumors."

It has been widely known that proper steroidogenesis in Leydig cells and sex-related genes in Sertoli cells play important roles in gonadal sex differentiation. In teleosts, the precise interaction of these signals during the sexual fate determination remains elusive, especially their effect on the bi-potential gonad during the critical stage of sexual fate determination. Recently, all-testis phenotypes have been observed in the cyp17a1-deficient zebrafish and common carp, as well as in cyp19a1a-deficient zebrafish. By mating cyp17a1-deficient fish with transgenic zebrafish Tg(piwil1:EGFP-nanos3UTR), germ cells in the gonads were labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We classified the cyp17a1-deficient zebrafish and their control siblings into primordial germ cell (PGC)-rich and -less groups according to the fluorescence area of the EGFP labelling. Intriguingly, the EGFP-labelled bi-potential gonads in cyp17a1+/+ fish from the PGC-rich group were significantly larger than those of the cyp17a1−/− fish at 23 days post-fertilization (dpf). Based on the transcriptome analysis, we observed that the cyp17a1-deficient fish of the PGC-rich group displayed a significantly upregulated expression of amh and gsdf compared to that of control fish. Likewise, the upregulated expressions of amh and gsdf were observed in cyp19a1a-deficient fish as examined at 23 dpf. This upregulation of amh and gsdf could be repressed by treatment with an exogenous supplement of estradiol. Moreover, tamoxifen, an effective antagonist of both estrogen receptor α and β (ERα and Erβ), upregulates the expression of amh and gsdf in wild-type (WT) fish. Using the cyp17a1- and cyp19a1a-deficient zebrafish, we provide evidence to show that the upregulated expression of amh and gsdf due to the compromised estrogen signaling probably determines their sexual fate towards testis differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest that estrogen signaling inhibits the expression of amh and gsdf during the critical time of sexual fate determination, which may broaden the scope of sex steroid hormones in regulating gonadal sex differentiation in fish.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855942', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031740', 'CorpusId': 267482988, 'PubMed': '38339020'}",1,"Given that the mechanism of fish gonadal sex differentiation involves intricate interactions between steroidogenesis in Leydig cells and sex-related genes in Sertoli cells, our research aims to explore the role of estrogen signaling in this process.

Here, we dissect the thermo- and osmo-responsory behavior of the transcriptional repressor H-NS, an archetypal nucleoid-condensing sensory protein, ubiquitous in enterobacteria that infect the mammalian gut. Through experiments and thermodynamic modeling, we show that H-NS exhibits osmolarity, temperature and concentration dependent self-association, with a highly polydisperse native ensemble dominated by monomers, dimers, tetramers and octamers. The relative population of these oligomeric states is determined by an interplay between dimerization and higher-order oligomerization, which in turn drives a competition between weak homo- versus hetero-oligomerization of protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. A phosphomimetic mutation, Y61E, fully eliminates higher-order self-assembly and preserves only dimerization while weakening DNA binding, highlighting that oligomerization is a prerequisite for strong DNA binding. We further demonstrate the presence of long-distance thermodynamic connectivity between dimerization and oligomerization sites on H-NS which influences the binding of the co-repressor Cnu, and switches the DNA binding mode of the hetero-oligomeric H-NS:Cnu complex. Our work thus uncovers important organizational principles in H-NS including a multi-layered thermodynamic control, and provides a molecular framework broadly applicable to other thermo-osmo sensory proteins that employ similar mechanisms to regulate gene expression.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10954469', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae090', 'CorpusId': 267616453, 'PubMed': '38340344'}",1,"Given that environmentally regulated gene expression is vital for bacterial survival under stress conditions, this study explores the behavior of the transcriptional repressor H-NS in response to temperature and osmolarity changes. The research reveals that H-NS self-associates in a manner dependent on these environmental factors, forming various oligomeric states which are crucial for its DNA binding capabilities. A specific mutation, Y61E, disrupts higher-order self-assembly and weakens DNA binding, underscoring the importance of oligomerization. The study also identifies a thermodynamic connection between the dimerization and oligomerization sites of H-NS, affecting its interaction with the co-repressor Cnu and altering DNA binding modes. These findings offer a molecular framework for understanding the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental stress, which could be applicable to other sensory proteins with similar mechanisms."

PCNA encircling duplex DNA is quite stable and is removed from DNA by the dedicated clamp unloader Elg1-RFC. Here, we show the cryo-EM structure of Elg1-RFC in various states with PCNA. The structures reveal essential features of Elg1-RFC that explain how it is dedicated to PCNA unloading. Specifically, Elg1 contains two external loops that block opening of the Elg1-RFC complex for DNA binding, and an “Elg1 plug” domain that fills the central DNA binding chamber, thereby reinforcing the exclusive PCNA unloading activity of Elg1-RFC. Elg1-RFC was capable of unloading PCNA using non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP. Both RFC and Elg1-RFC could remove PCNA from covalently closed circular DNA, indicating that PCNA unloading occurs by a mechanism that is distinct from PCNA loading. Implications for the PCNA unloading mechanism are discussed.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10906927', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adl1739', 'CorpusId': 268119673, 'PubMed': '38427736'}",1,"Given that PCNA is critical for DNA replication and requires precise loading and unloading mechanisms, this research elucidates the structural basis by which Elg1-RFC specifically facilitates PCNA unloading.

However, the influence of seed GSL and EA contents on the germination process under drought stress remains poorly understood. Herein, 114 rapeseed accessions were divided into four groups based on GSL and EA contents to investigate their performance during seed imbibition under drought stress. Our results revealed significant variations in seed germination-related traits, particularly with higher GSL and EA, which exhibited higher germination % (G%) and lower mean germination time (MGT) under drought stress conditions. Moreover, osmoregulation, enzymatic system and hormonal regulation were improved in high GSL and high EA (HGHE) versus low GSL and low EA (LGLE) seeds, indicating the essential protective role of GSL and EA during the germination process in response to drought stress. The transcriptional regulation mechanism for coordinating GSL–EA-related pathways in response to drought stress during seed imbibition was found to involve the differential expression of sugar metabolism-, antioxidant-, and hormone-related genes with higher enrichment in HGHE compared to LGLE seeds. GO enrichment analysis showed higher variations in transcription regulator activity and DNA-binding transcription factors, as well as ATP and microtubule motor activity in GSL–EA-related pathways. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified cellular processes, environmental information processing, and metabolism categories, with varied gene participation between GSL, EA and GSL–EA-related pathways. For further clarification, QY7 (LGLE) seeds were primed with different concentrations of GSL and EA under drought stress conditions. The results showed that 200 μmol/L of GSL and 400 μmol/L of EA significantly improved G%, MGT, and seedling fresh weight, besides regulating stress and fatty acid responsive genes during the seed germination process under drought stress conditions. Conclusively, exogenous application of GSL and EA is considered a promising method for enhancing the drought tolerance of LGLE seeds. Furthermore, the current investigation could provide a theoretical basis of GSL and EA roles and their underlying mechanisms in stress tolerance during the germination process.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970144', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063308', 'CorpusId': 268456434, 'PubMed': '38542283'}",1,"Given that the quality of rapeseed seeds is influenced by glucosinolate (GSL) and erucic acid (EA) contents, this study explores their impact on seed germination under drought stress.

Enhanced osmoregulation, enzymatic activity, and hormonal regulation were observed in high GSL and EA seeds, suggesting these compounds play a protective role during germination. Differential gene expression related to sugar metabolism, antioxidants, and hormones was identified, with significant enrichment in high GSL and EA seeds. Functional analyses indicated active transcription regulation and cellular processes influenced by GSL and EA. Furthermore, priming low GSL and EA seeds with specific concentrations of these compounds improved drought tolerance, highlighting the potential of exogenous GSL and EA application to enhance germination under stress. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the roles and mechanisms of GSL and EA in stress tolerance during seed germination."

Nevertheless, the quantitative electrophysiological behavior of RBCs and its heterogeneity are still not completely understood. Here, we use state-of-the-art biochemical methods to probe for the abundance of the channels in RBCs. Furthermore, we utilize automated patch clamp, based on planar chips, to compare the activity of the two channels in reticulocytes and mature RBCs. In addition to this characterization, we performed membrane potential measurements to demonstrate the effect of channel activity and interplay on the RBC properties. Both the Gárdos channel and Piezo1, albeit their average copy number of activatable channels per cell is in the single-digit range, can be detected through transcriptome analysis of reticulocytes. Proteomics analysis of reticulocytes and mature RBCs could only detect Piezo1 but not the Gárdos channel. Furthermore, they can be reliably measured in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp method. While for the Gárdos channel, the activity in terms of ion currents is higher in reticulocytes compared to mature RBCs, for Piezo1, the tendency is the opposite. While the interplay between Piezo1 and Gárdos channel cannot be followed using the patch clamp measurements, it could be proved based on membrane potential measurements in populations of intact RBCs. We discuss the Gárdos channel and Piezo1 abundance, interdependencies and interactions in the context of their proposed physiological and pathophysiological functions, which are the passing of small constrictions, e.g., in the spleen, and their active participation in blood clot formation and thrombosis.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855361', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031416', 'CorpusId': 267231030, 'PubMed': '38338693'}",1,"Given that the quantitative electrophysiological behavior and heterogeneity of ion channels in red blood cells (RBCs) are not fully understood, our research proposes to investigate the abundance and activity of the Gárdos channel (KCNN4) and Piezo1 in RBCs using advanced biochemical methods and automated patch clamp techniques.

We found that this potentiation is associated with a transition from facilitating tonic to depressing phasic mode of release caused by GBR- and activity-dependent recruitment of release-ready vesicles at a looser coupling distance than the tonic-release vesicles. CAPS2 (Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 2) retains these vesicles there for minutes contributing to a persistent potentiation.

Here, we use a chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) mouse model to study the effect of VNS on T-dependent B cell responses. We observed lower titers of high-affinity IgG and fewer antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cells. GC B cells from chronic VNS mice exhibited altered mRNA and protein expression suggesting increased apoptosis and impaired plasma cell differentiation. Follicular dendritic cell (FDC) cluster dispersal and altered gene expression suggested poor function. The absence of acetylcholine-producing CD4+ T cells diminished these alterations. In vitro studies revealed that α7 and α9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) directly regulated B cell production of TNF, a cytokine crucial to FDC clustering. α4 nAChR inhibited coligation of CD19 to the B cell receptor, presumably decreasing B cell survival. Thus, VNS-induced GC impairment can be attributed to distinct effects of nAChRs on B cells.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11051663', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adn3760', 'CorpusId': 269408029, 'PubMed': '38669336'}",1,"Given that chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can influence immune responses, this study explores its impact on T-dependent B cell antibody production.

Additionally, VNS appears to disrupt follicular dendritic cell (FDC) clusters and their function. The absence of acetylcholine-producing CD4+ T cells mitigated these effects. The study further identifies that specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on B cells regulate key processes such as TNF production and B cell receptor coligation, thereby influencing GC B cell survival and function. This suggests that VNS-induced GC impairment is mediated through distinct nAChR pathways on B cells."

While surgery can provide temporary relief from women’s pain, symptoms often return in as many as 75% of cases within two years. Previous literature has contributed to theories about the development of endometriosis; however, the exact pathogenesis and etiology remain elusive. We conducted a preliminary investigation into the influence of primary endometrial cells (ECs) on the development and progression of endometriosis. In vitro studies, they were involved in inducing Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rat-isolated primary endometrial cells, which resulted in increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA gene expression (quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, qPCR) and protein expression (western blot analysis). Additionally, in vivo studies utilized autogenic and allogeneic transplantations (rat to rat) to investigate endometriosis-like lesion cyst size, body weight, protein levels (immunohistochemistry), and mRNA gene expression. These studies demonstrated that estrogen upregulates the gene and protein regulation of cytoskeletal (CK)-18, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, particularly in the peritoneum. These findings may influence cell proliferation, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and inflammation markers. Consequently, this could exacerbate the occurrence and progression of endometriosis.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11011664', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25073873', 'CorpusId': 268847778, 'PubMed': '38612685'}",1,"Given that endometriosis is a prevalent and recurrent gynecological condition with poorly understood mechanisms, our research aims to further elucidate the cellular and molecular processes contributing to its pathogenesis.

Moreover, estrogen appears to enhance the expression of critical proteins and genes, including CK-18, TGF-β, VEGF, and TNF-α, particularly within the peritoneum, thereby promoting cell proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation.

In a double-blind, cross-over design, eight moderately trained female swimmers (age: 21.3 ± 1.4 years, height: 161.2 ± 7.1 cm, body mass: 56.3 ± 6.7 kg, body mass index (BMI): 21.9 ± 1.3 kg/m2, and habitual CAF intake: 246.4 ± 111.4 mg/day) ingested caffeine (CAF) (6 mg/kg) or a placebo (PLA) 60 min before completing VJ, balance, ART, and 25/50 m FSP. CAF supplementation resulted in a significantly lower time both in 25m (p = 0.032) and 50m (p = 0.033) FSP. However, CAF resulted in no significant difference in VJ, ART, and RPE (p > 0.05). Balance test results showed a non-significant moderate main effect (d = 0.58). In conclusion, CAF seems to reduce time in short-distance swimming performances, which could be the determinant of success considering the total time of the race.

Based on the obtained X-ray crystal structures of CHS, CHI, and chalcone isomerase-like protein (CHIL) from the same monocotyledon, Panicum virgatum, along with the results of the steady-state kinetics, spectroscopic/thermodynamic analyses, intermolecular interactions, and their effect on each catalytic step are proposed. In addition, PvCHI’s unique activity for both naringenin chalcone and isoliquiritigenin was analyzed, and the observed hierarchical activity for those type-I and -II substrates was explained with the intrinsic characteristics of the enzyme and two substrates. The structure of PvCHS complexed with naringenin supports uncompetitive inhibition. PvCHS displays intrinsic catalytic promiscuity, evident from the formation of p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL) in addition to naringenin chalcone. In the presence of PvCHIL, conversion of p-coumaroyl-CoA to naringenin through PvCHS and PvCHI displayed ~400-fold increased Vmax with reduced formation of CTAL by 70%. Supporting this model, molecular docking, ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry), and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) indicated that both PvCHI and PvCHIL interact with PvCHS in a non-competitive manner, indicating the plausible allosteric effect of naringenin on CHS. Significantly, the presence of naringenin increased the affinity between PvCHS and PvCHIL, whereas naringenin chalcone decreased the affinity, indicating a plausible feedback mechanism to minimize spontaneous incorrect stereoisomers.

However, the extent and functional significance of NRSs in the human genomes and populations remains unclear. Here, we de novo assembled 539 genomes from five genetically divergent human populations using long-read sequencing technology, resulting in the identification of 5.1 million NRSs. These were merged into 45284 unique NRSs, with 29.7% being novel discoveries. Among these NRSs, 38.7% were common across the five populations, and 35.6% were population specific. The use of a graph-based pangenome approach allowed for the detection of 565 transcript expression quantitative trait loci on NRSs, with 426 of these being novel findings. Moreover, 26 NRS candidates displayed evidence of adaptive selection within human populations. Genes situated in close proximity to or intersecting with these candidates may be associated with metabolism and type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies revealed 14 NRSs to be significantly associated with eight phenotypes.

Misinformation or misconceptions about these necessities are prevalent among young athletes. This study investigated nutrition and hydration knowledge and practices among 28 male rugby union players aged 16 to 17, participating in Munster Rugby’s 2023 Summer Age-Grade Development Programme, specifically the U18′s Schools Squad. The Nutrition for Sport Knowledge Questionnaire assessed nutrition knowledge, while the Hydration Assessment Questionnaire evaluated hydration knowledge. Urinalysis for hydration status utilised urine specific gravity measurements pre-exercise on five separate days (1.018 ± 0.008 Usg). Dietary intake was recorded using a 3-day estimated food intake record on the Libro App, analysed with Nutritics software(Version 9.50). Suboptimal nutrition knowledge (49.6 ± 8.2%) and dietary practices were observed, with incongruent nutrient intakes compared to recommendations for adolescent athletes. While superior hydration knowledge (79.0 (77.3, 83.6) %) was evident, pre-exercise urine specific gravity readings indicated significant variation (p < 0.001) and signs of dehydration (USG > 1.020 Usg). No statistically significant correlations were found between knowledge and practices. The study highlights suboptimal nutrition and hydration knowledge and practices in youth athletes, suggesting the need for tailored support and educational interventions to enhance their overall health and performance. Further investigation into barriers and facilitators to dietary adherence is recommended for more effective interventions.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10891571', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16040533', 'CorpusId': 267691477, 'PubMed': '38398857'}",1,"Given that optimal athletic performance hinges on proper nutrition and hydration, there is a critical need to address the prevalent misinformation and misconceptions among young athletes.

However, our understanding of the molecular regulation of petal growth in chrysanthemums remains limited. The GASA (gibberellic acid [GA]-stimulated Arabidopsis) protein plays a significant role in various aspects of plant growth and development. Previous studies have indicated that GEG (a gerbera homolog of the gibberellin-stimulated transcript 1 [GAST1] from tomato) is involved in regulating ray petal growth by inhibiting cell expansion in gerberas. In this study, we successfully cloned the GASA family gene from chrysanthemums, naming it CmGEG, which shares 81.4% homology with GEG. Our spatiotemporal expression analysis revealed that CmGEG is expressed in all tissues, with the highest expression levels observed in the ray florets, particularly during the later stages of development. Through transformation experiments, we demonstrated that CmGEG inhibits petal elongation in chrysanthemums. Further observations indicated that CmGEG restricts cell elongation in the top, middle, and basal regions of the petals. To investigate the relationship between CmGEG and GA in petal growth, we conducted a hormone treatment assay using detached chrysanthemum petals. Our results showed that GA promotes petal elongation while downregulating CmGEG expression. In conclusion, the constrained growth of chrysanthemum petals may be attributed to the inhibition of cell elongation by CmGEG, a process regulated by GA.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970651', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063367', 'CorpusId': 268580063, 'PubMed': '38542341'}",1,"Given that the diversity in chrysanthemum petal morphology presents an ideal model for studying petal size regulation, this research proposes investigating the molecular mechanisms behind petal growth, focusing on the role of the GASA family gene, CmGEG.

In addition to preserving male fertility, it is sometimes used for overcoming logistical issues. Despite its proven clinical usability and safety, there is a lack of knowledge of how it affects spermatozoa at the molecular level, especially in terms of non-coding RNAs. Therefore, we conducted this study, where we compared slow freezing and vitrification of good- and poor-quality human semen samples by analyzing conventional sperm quality parameters, performing functional tests and analyzing the expression of miRNAs. The results revealed that cryopreservation of normozoospermic samples does not alter the maturity of spermatozoa (protamine staining, hyaluronan binding), although cryopreservation can increase sperm DNA fragmentation and lower motility. On a molecular level, we revealed that in both types of cryopreservation, miRNAs from spermatozoa are significantly overexpressed compared to those in the native semen of normozoospermic patients, but in oligozoospermic samples, this effect is observed only after vitrification. Moreover, we show that expression of selected miRNAs is mostly overexpressed in native oligozoospermic samples compared to normozoospermic samples. Conversely, when vitrified normozoospermic and oligozoospermic samples were compared, we determined that only miR-99b-5p was significantly overexpressed in oligozoospermic sperm samples, and when comparing slow freezing, only miR-15b-5p and miR-34b-3p were significantly under-expressed in oligozoospermic sperm samples. Therefore, our results imply that cryopreservation of normozoospermic sperm samples can modulate miRNA expression profiles in spermatozoa to become comparable to those in oligozoospermic samples.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050687', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084157', 'CorpusId': 269068859, 'PubMed': '38673743'}",1,"Given that semen cryopreservation is essential in medically assisted reproduction and logistical management of male fertility, this study aims to elucidate its molecular impact, particularly focusing on non-coding RNAs.

Potential drug targets can depict aquaporins, as they are involved in immunological processes. In immune cells, AQP3 and AQP9 are of special interest. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these aquaporins are expressed in the blood cells of septic patients and impact sepsis survival. Clinical data, routine laboratory parameters, and blood samples from septic patients were analyzed on day 1 and day 8 after sepsis diagnosis. AQP expression and cytokine serum concentrations were measured. AQP3 mRNA expression increased over the duration of sepsis and was correlated with lymphocyte count. High AQP3 expression was associated with increased survival. In contrast, AQP9 expression was not altered during sepsis and was correlated with neutrophil count, and low levels of AQP9 were associated with increased survival. Furthermore, AQP9 expression was an independent risk factor for sepsis lethality. In conclusion, AQP3 and AQP9 may play contrary roles in the pathophysiology of sepsis, and these results suggest that AQP9 may be a novel drug target in sepsis and, concurrently, a valuable biomarker of the disease.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816878', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021209', 'CorpusId': 267194686, 'PubMed': '38279209'}",1,"Given that aquaporins, particularly AQP3 and AQP9, are implicated in the immunological processes associated with sepsis, this study explores their expression in blood cells of septic patients and their potential impact on sepsis survival.

The risk of thrombotic events increases with age. Available data suggest that minerals taken with diet can affect the course of thrombosis. However, little is known about the relationship between platelet aggregability and mineral intake with diet among elderly people. Thus, we evaluated the associations between the reactivities of platelets to arachidonic acid, collagen or ADP and the estimated quantities of minerals consumed as a part of the daily diet in 246 subjects aged 60–65 years (124 men and 122 women). The found simple (not-adjusted) Spearman’s rank negative correlations are as follows: 1. arachidonate-dependent aggregation and the amounts of potassium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, copper and manganese; 2. collagen-dependent aggregation and the amounts of potassium, phosphorus, iron and zinc; and 3. ADP-dependent aggregation and the amounts of potassium, phosphorus and zinc. The negative associations between ADP-dependent platelet reactivity and the amount of potassium, phosphorus and zinc and between collagen-dependent aggregability and the amount of phosphorus were also noted after adjusting for a bunch of cardiovascular risk factors.

Positive and negative regulators control RAD51 filament assembly and disassembly. RAD51 is vital for genome integrity but excessive accumulation of RAD51 on chromatin causes genome instability and growth defects. However, the detailed mechanism underlying RAD51 disassembly by negative regulators and the physiological consequence of abnormal RAD51 persistence remain largely unknown. Here, we report the role of the human AAA+ ATPase FIGNL1 in suppressing a novel type of RAD51-mediated genome instability. FIGNL1 knockout human cells were defective in RAD51 dissociation after replication fork restart and accumulated ultra-fine chromosome bridges (UFBs), whose formation depends on RAD51 rather than replication fork stalling. FIGNL1 suppresses homologous recombination intermediate-like UFBs generated between sister chromatids at genomic loci with repeated sequences such as telomeres and centromeres. These data suggest that RAD51 persistence per se induces the formation of unresolved linkage between sister chromatids resulting in catastrophic genome instability. FIGNL1 facilitates post-replicative disassembly of RAD51 filament to suppress abnormal recombination intermediates and UFBs. These findings implicate FIGNL1 as a key factor required for active RAD51 removal after processing of stalled replication forks, which is essential to maintain genome stability.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11162793', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae263', 'CorpusId': 269032466, 'PubMed': '38597669'}",1,"Given that RAD51 filament is essential for DNA repair and genomic integrity, our proposed research aims to explore the mechanisms regulating RAD51 disassembly and the consequences of its persistence.

The modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS2.0) is the gold standard questionnaire to measure FA, while another tool is the Measure of Eating Compulsivity 10 (MEC10). Discriminant validity is present when two measures of similar but distinct constructs show a correlation that is low enough for the factors to be regarded as distinct. However, the discriminant validity of these measures has never been tested. Through a cross-sectional study design, 717 inpatients (females: 56.20%, age: 53.681 ± 12.74) with severe obesity completed the MEC10, Binge Eating Scale (BES), and mYFAS2.0. A structural equation model (SEM) was fitted, freely estimating latent correlations with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The results confirmed the scales’ excellent psychometric properties. Importantly, latent factor correlations between MEC10 and mYFAS2.0 (est = 0.783, 95% CI [0.76, 0.80]) supported their discriminant validity. In contrast, the latent correlation of MEC10 and BES (est = 0.86, 95% CI [0.84, 0.87]) exceeded the recommended thresholds, indicating the absence of discriminant validity and suggesting a potential overlap, consistent with previous evidence.

First, using a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model, we confirmed that SPAM1 improves the structure of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and restores the number of neurons. Compared with D-gal model mice, SPAM1-treated mice showed up-regulated expression of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and Lamin B1 and down-regulated expression of YinYang 1 (YY1) and p16. A similar tendency was observed in senescent RGC-5 cells induced by long-term culture, indicating that SPAM1 exhibits significant in vitro and in vivo anti-senescence activity in neurons. Then, using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis, we further explored the mechanism behind SPAM1’s neuroprotective effects and found that SPAM is involved in the longevity-regulating pathway. Finally, the up-regulation of neurofilament light and medium polypeptides indicated by the proteomics results was further confirmed by Western blotting.

Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, which is an important stem cell source for endogenous periodontal tissue regeneration. Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a novel post-translational modification of proteins that is recently thought to be associated with osteogenic differentiation. Here, we found that lactylation levels are reduced both in the periodontal tissue of rats with periodontitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human PDLSCs. Proanthocyanidins were able to promote the osteogenesis of inflamed PDLSCs by restoring lactylation levels. Mechanistically, proanthocyanidins increased lactate production and restored the lactylation levels of PDLSCs, which recovered osteogenesis of inflamed PDLSCs via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These results provide evidence on how epigenetic regulation by pharmacological agents influence the osteogenic phenotype of stem cells and the process of periodontal tissue repair.

In this paper, we argue that whether AI is conscious is less of a concern than the fact that AI can be considered conscious by users during human-AI interaction, because this ascription of consciousness can lead to carry-over effects on human-human interaction. When AI is viewed as conscious like a human, then how people treat AI appears to carry over into how they treat other people due to activating schemas that are congruent to those activated during interactions with humans. In light of this potential, we might consider regulating how we treat AI, or how we build AI to evoke certain kinds of treatment from users, but not because AI is inherently sentient. This argument focuses on humanlike, social actor AI such as chatbots, digital voice assistants, and social robots. In the first part of the paper, we provide evidence for carry-over effects between perceptions of AI consciousness and behavior toward humans through literature on human-computer interaction, human-AI interaction, and the psychology of artificial agents. In the second part of the paper, we detail how the mechanism of schema activation can allow us to test consciousness perception as a driver of carry-over effects between human-AI interaction and human-human interaction. In essence, perceiving AI as conscious like a human, thereby activating congruent mind schemas during interaction, is a driver for behaviors and perceptions of AI that can carry over into how we treat humans. Therefore, the fact that people can ascribe humanlike consciousness to AI is worth considering, and moral protection for AI is also worth considering, regardless of AI’s inherent conscious or moral status.",2024,Frontiers in Psychology,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11008604', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1322781', 'CorpusId': 268786566, 'PubMed': '38605842'}",1,"Given that the ascription of consciousness to artificial intelligence (AI) by users can impact human-human interactions through schema activation, my research proposes to investigate the implications of these carry-over effects on social behavior and ethical considerations.

By examining the literature on human-computer interaction, human-AI interaction, and the psychology of artificial agents, we can understand how these perceptions shape social behavior. Moreover, exploring the mechanism of schema activation could offer insights into regulating AI design and interaction to foster positive human behaviors.

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are one of the most relevant causes of death globally, frequently associated with poor dietary patterns. The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) contributes to cancer prevention. To assess adherence to MedDiet, our research group validated a new score, the Chrono Med Diet Score (CMDS), that captures increased visceral adiposity. Methods. We enrolled 401 subjects who underwent an evaluation for metabolic diseases and specific screening procedures according to current guidelines and were asked to answer CMDS. A total of 71 new cancer cases were recorded, including 40 GI and 31 non-gastrointestinal (NON-GI) cancers. Results. We found that CMDS was reduced in subjects who were diagnosed with cancers. Patients who reported a CMDS score of 12 or less had an over three times increased risk of being diagnosed with GI cancers and presented increased waist circumference and triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol compared to adherent subjects. Conclusions. Low CMDS values capture the risk for cancer diagnosis, especially for GI cancers. Thus, CMDS, along with waist circumference, can be considered as a bona fide marker for increased risk of cancer, requiring anticipated screening procedures for the detection of premalignant and early stage GI cancers in patients with low adherence to MedDiet.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10933917', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16050630', 'CorpusId': 268050305, 'PubMed': '38474758'}",1,"Given that gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a significant global cause of mortality often linked to poor dietary habits, our proposed research aims to investigate the utility of a validated dietary adherence score, the Chrono Med Diet Score (CMDS), in identifying individuals at increased risk for GI cancers.

In the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), eCB signaling plays a major role in balancing excitation and inhibition and promoting habitual learning. The aim of this study was to outline the role of astrocytes in regulating eCB signaling in the DLS. To this end, we employed electrophysiological slice recordings combined with metabolic, chemogenetic and pharmacological approaches in an attempt to selectively suppress astrocyte function. High-frequency stimulation induced eCB-mediated LTD (HFS-LTD) in brain slices from both male and female rats. The metabolic uncoupler fluorocitrate (FC) reduced the probability of transmitter release and depressed synaptic output in a manner that was independent on cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) activation. Fluorocitrate did not affect the LTD induced by the CB1R agonist WIN55,212-2, but enhanced CB1R-dependent HFS-LTD. Reduced neurotransmission and facilitated HFS-LTD were also observed during chemogenetic manipulation using Gi-coupled DREADDs targeting glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells, during the pharmacological inhibition of connexins using carbenoxolone disodium, or during astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA. While pretreatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) failed to prevent synaptic depression induced by FC, it blocked the facilitation of HFS-LTD.

The experimental methods included assessment of growth; 24-7 activity levels; motor coordination; learning and memory; blood-based amino acid, phytoestrogen and glucose levels; and organ weights. The primary outcome measure was body weight. We find increased body weight in male Fmr1KO from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P224, male wild type (WT) from P32–P39, female Fmr1KO from P6–P18 and P168–P224, and female Fmr1HET from P9–P18 as a function of soy. Activity at the beginning of the light and dark cycles increased in female Fmr1HET and Fmr1KO mice fed soy. We did not find significant differences in rotarod or passive avoidance behavior as a function of genotype or diet. Several blood-based amino acids and phytoestrogens were significantly altered in response to soy. Liver weight was increased in WT and adipose tissue in Fmr1KO mice fed soy. Activity levels at the beginning of the light cycle and testes weight were greater in Fmr1KO versus WT males irrespective of diet. DEXA analysis at 8-months-old indicated increased fat mass and total body area in Fmr1KO females and lean mass and bone mineral density in Fmr1KO males fed soy. Overall, dietary consumption of soy protein isolate by C57BL/6J mice caused increased growth, which could be attributed to increased lean mass in males and fat mass in females. There were sex-specific differences with more pronounced effects in Fmr1KO versus WT and in males versus females.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10819477', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020284', 'CorpusId': 267093487, 'PubMed': '38257177'}",1,"Given that obesity is a significant issue among children with developmental disabilities, the impact of dietary soy protein on weight gain and neurobehavioral outcomes warrants investigation. This study tested the effects of soy protein-based diets compared to casein-based diets in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (Fmr1KO mice). The research revealed that soy protein consumption resulted in increased body weight, with variations based on sex and genotype, such as greater lean mass in males and fat mass in females. Additionally, activity levels and certain blood-based biomarkers were influenced by the diet, suggesting that dietary soy protein has complex, sex-specific effects on growth and metabolism in this model. This highlights the potential implications of soy protein in managing obesity and developmental outcomes in children with similar conditions."

The structural protein GP5 of PRRSV plays a pivotal role in its pathogenicity and immune evasion. Virus–host interactions play a crucial part in viral replication and immune escape. Therefore, understanding the interactions between GP5 and host proteins are significant for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) control. However, the interaction network between GP5 and host proteins in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) has not been reported. In this study, 709 GP5-interacting host proteins were identified in primary PAMs by immunoprecipitation coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in multiple cellular processes, such as translation, protein transport, and protein stabilization. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assay confirmed that GP5 could interact with antigen processing and presentation pathways related proteins. Finally, we found that GP5 may be a key protein that inhibits the antigen processing and presentation pathway during PRRSV infection. The novel host proteins identified in this study will be the candidates for studying the biological functions of GP5, which will provide new insights into PRRS prevention and vaccine development.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10932240', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25052778', 'CorpusId': 268199087, 'PubMed': '38474030'}",1,"Given that the structural protein GP5 of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is crucial in its pathogenicity and immune evasion, this study aims to elucidate the interaction network between GP5 and host proteins in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs).

Initially labelled a “gay disease” due to its prevalence among gay men, the spread of HIV led to widespread fear and moral panic, as there was limited medical knowledge on preventing its transmission. While HIV is often associated with Sub-Saharan Africa, this article focuses on Sweden, a pioneering nation that became the first to achieve the remarkable Joint UNAIDS/WHO 90-90-90 continuum in addressing the epidemic. However, despite this significant milestone, the punitive legislation and attitudes prevalent in Sweden have had a counterproductive effect on curbing the virus’s spread. Drawing upon a comprehensive triangulation of various data and sources on the evolution of public policy in Sweden, this article argues for the urgent need to reduce stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS. By undertaking further measures to combat stigmatisation, we not only have the potential to prevent the spread of HIV but also significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals living with the virus. An essential step in this journey is to eliminate the legally-enforced mandatory disclosure of one’s HIV status, which would mark a tremendous victory for all those affected. With limited evidence to support the effectiveness of criminalisation and penal laws, no longer being viewed as criminals for non-disclosure would be a monumental achievement, positively transforming the lives of people living with HIV and fostering a more inclusive and supportive society.",2024,PLoS ONE,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10883528', 'DOI': '10.1371/journal.pone.0298630', 'CorpusId': 267807332, 'PubMed': '38386666'}",1,"Given that punitive legislation and stigma surrounding HIV have been counterproductive in curbing the virus’s spread despite Sweden's achievement of the Joint UNAIDS/WHO 90-90-90 targets, my research proposes to investigate the impact of decriminalizing the non-disclosure of HIV status on public health outcomes and the quality of life for people living with HIV.

Caloric restriction is known to promote this phenomenon, but the impact of macronutrient changes during dieting remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of macronutrient changes in weight maintenance without caloric restriction by alternating between two hypercaloric diets: a high-carbohydrate, high-fat Western diet (WD) and a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (LCHDF). Obesity was induced in 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice by 10 weeks of WD feeding. Then, the mice were subjected to 12 weeks of LCHFD interspersed with WD (I-WD), 3 periods of 2-week LCHFD followed by 2 periods of 3-week WD, or 12 weeks of continuous WD (C-WD). C-WD and I-WD mice were compared to standard diet (SD) mice. In the I-WD group, each LCHFD period decreased weight gain, but mice regained weight after WD resumption. I-WD mice exhibited obesity, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance, similarly to the C-WD mice. I-WD mice also developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, associated with an increase in type-III collagen gene expression and a decrease in FGF21 protein levels, in comparison with SD. I-WD mice developed weight cycling despite maintaining a high caloric consumption, suggesting that changes in macronutrients during dieting are also a trigger of weight regain.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10933974', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16050646', 'CorpusId': 268167527, 'PubMed': '38474774'}",1,"Given that weight cycling is a significant obstacle in obesity management, our research aims to investigate the role of macronutrient changes in weight maintenance without caloric restriction.

Kidney ECs (n = 5464) were collected at three timepoints from diabetic BTBRob/ob mice and non-diabetic littermates. Their heterogeneity, transcriptional changes, and alternative splicing during DKD progression were mapped using SmartSeq2 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and elucidated through pathway, network, and gene ontology enrichment analyses. We identified 13 distinct transcriptional EC phenotypes corresponding to different kidney vessel subtypes, confirmed through in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. EC subtypes along nephrons displayed extensive zonation related to their functions. Differential gene expression analyses in peritubular and glomerular ECs in DKD underlined the regulation of DKD-relevant pathways including EIF2 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and IGF1 signaling. Importantly, this revealed the differential alteration of these pathways between the two EC subtypes and changes during disease progression. Furthermore, glomerular and peritubular ECs also displayed aberrant and dynamic alterations in alternative splicing (AS), which is strongly associated with DNA repair. Strikingly, genes displaying differential transcription or alternative splicing participate in divergent biological processes.

The inhibition of endothelial autophagy is associated with the reduced expression of protein disulfide isomerase 4 (PDIA-4); however, its role in endothelial cells is not known. Here, we report that endothelial cell-specific loss of PDIA-4 leads to impaired autophagic flux accompanied by loss of endothelial function and apoptosis. Endothelial cell-specific loss of PDIA-4 also induced marked changes in endothelial cell architecture, accompanied by the loss of endothelial markers and the gain of mesenchymal markers consistent with endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). The loss of PDIA-4 activated TGFβ-signaling, and inhibition of TGFβ-signaling suppressed EndMT in PDIA-4-silenced endothelial cells in vitro.

Of particular interest is elucidating these mechanisms in the preclinical stage of PD, which lasts decades before diagnosis and is therefore not available for study in patients. Therefore, our main goal was to study the initial molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of PD in the striatum, the key center for dopamine regulation in motor function, in a mouse model of the earliest preclinical stage of PD, from 1 to 24 h after the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). It was shown that the content of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first enzyme in dopamine synthesis, does not change within 6 h after the administration of MPTP, but decreases after 24 h. In turn, TH activity increases after 1 h, decreases after 3 h, remains at the control level after 6 h, and decreases 24 h after the administration of MPTP. The concentration of dopamine in the striatum gradually decreases after MPTP administration, despite a decrease in its degradation.

Recently, a specific link between IAV infection and neurodegenerative disease progression has been established. The non-structural NS1 protein of IAV regulates viral replication during infection and antagonizes host antiviral responses, contributing to influenza virulence. In the present study, we have prepared a mouse lung-to-lung adapted to the NS1-truncated virus (NS80ad). Transcriptome analysis of the gene expression in the lungs revealed that infection with wild-type A/WSN/33 (WSN), NS80, and NS80ad viruses resulted in different regulation of genes involved in signaling pathways associated with the cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and development of neurodegenerative diseases. NS1 protein did not influence the genes involved in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in the brains. Lethal infection with IAVs dysregulated expression of proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases (CX3CL1/Fractalkine, Coagulation factor III, and CD105/Endoglin, CD54/ICAM-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C, and LDL R). Transcription of GATA3 mRNA was decreased, and expression of MPO was inhibited in the brain infected with NS80 and NS80ad viruses. In addition, the truncation of NS1 protein led to reduced expression of IGFBP-2, CHI3L1, MPO, and LDL-R proteins in the brains. Our results indicate that the influenza virus influences the expression of proteins involved in brain function, and this might occur mostly through the NS1 protein.

However, with age and cataract formation, the concentration of αABc in the eye lens cytoplasm decreases, with a corresponding increase in the membrane-bound αABc. This study uses the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling method to investigate the role of cholesterol (Chol) and Chol bilayer domains (CBDs) in the binding of αAc, αBc, and αABc to the Chol/model of human lens-lipid (Chol/MHLL) membranes. The maximum percentage of membrane surface occupied (MMSO) by αAc, αBc, and αABc to Chol/MHLL membranes at a mixing ratio of 0 followed the trends: MMSO (αAc) > MMSO (αBc) ≈ MMSO (αABc), indicating that a higher amount of αAc binds to these membranes compared to αBc and αABc. However, with an increase in the Chol concentration in the Chol/MHLL membranes, the MMSO by αAc, αBc, and αABc decreases until it is completely diminished at a mixing ratio of 1.5. The Ka of αAc, αBc, and αABc to Chol/MHLL membranes at a mixing ratio of 0 followed the trend: Ka (αBc) ≈ Ka (αABc) > Ka (αAc), but it was close to zero with the diminished binding at a Chol/MHLL mixing ratio of 1.5. The mobility near the membrane headgroup regions decreased with αAc, αBc, and αABc binding, and the Chol antagonized the capacity of the αAc, αBc, and αABc to decrease mobility near the headgroup regions. No significant change in membrane order near the headgroup regions was observed, with an increase in αAc, αBc, and αABc concentrations. Our results show that αAc, αBc, and αABc bind differently with Chol/MHLL membranes at mixing ratios of 0 and 0.5, decreasing the mobility and increasing hydrophobicity near the membrane headgroup region, likely forming the hydrophobic barrier for the passage of polar and ionic molecules, including antioxidants (glutathione), creating an oxidative environment inside the lens, leading to the development of cataracts. However, all binding was completely diminished at a mixing ratio of 1.5, indicating that high Chol and CBDs inhibit the binding of αAc, αBc, and αABc to membranes, preventing the formation of hydrophobic barriers and likely protecting against cataract formation.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855794', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031923', 'CorpusId': 267508701, 'PubMed': '38339200'}",1,"Given that α-crystallin (αABc), a key protein in the human eye lens, decreases in concentration within the cytoplasm but increases in membrane-bound form with age and cataract formation, this study investigates the binding dynamics of αA-crystallin (αAc), αB-crystallin (αBc), and αABc to cholesterol (Chol) and model human lens-lipid (Chol/MHLL) membranes using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling. The findings highlight that αAc exhibits a higher binding affinity to these membranes compared to αBc and αABc, with binding diminishing as Chol concentration increases.

However, molecular recombination is an important genome maintenance mechanism for all organisms, most notably being required for double-strand break repair. To demonstrate the existence of mtDNA recombination, we took advantage of a cell model with two different types of mitochondrial genomes and impaired its ability to degrade broken mtDNA. The resulting excess of linear DNA fragments caused increased formation of cruciform mtDNA, appearance of heterodimeric mtDNA complexes and recombinant mtDNA genomes, detectable by Southern blot and by long range PacBio® HiFi sequencing approach. Besides utilizing different electrophoretic methods, we also directly observed molecular complexes between different mtDNA haplotypes and recombination intermediates using transmission electron microscopy. We propose that the known copy-choice recombination by mitochondrial replisome could be sufficient for the needs of the small genome, thus removing the requirement for a specialized mitochondrial recombinase.

Here we focus on emotionally charged art and posit that affective affordances embedded into some artworks play a pivotal role in explaining why these artworks are enjoyed from an evolutionary perspective. Such features, recurring in various art forms, are interpreted as cues to the emotional state of others, enabling art consumers to engage in empathetic experiences and vicarious emotions. We explore the adaptive value of deriving pleasure from vicarious emotions, while also addressing the seemingly counterintuitive enjoyment of artworks that evoke negative emotions. We discuss the appreciation of vicarious emotions irrespective of their valence and maintain this appreciation to hold adaptive significance for three key reasons. Firstly, it aids art consumers in refining their interpretational schemes of internal states, potentially enhancing emotional regulation skills. Secondly, it contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotions of others, thereby fostering emotional intelligence and empathy.

The study involved eight early lactating Holstein cows (days in milk = 40 ± 9 days; milk yield 30 ± 1.5 kg/day; parity 1.09 ± 0.05, p < 0.05), four cows per experiment, with environmentally controlled chambers. In each experiment, two distinct heat stress conditions were created: a low-temperature and low-humidity (LTLH) condition at 25 °C with 35–50% humidity and a high-temperature and high-humidity (HTHH) condition at 31 °C with 80–95% humidity. During the adaptation phase, the cows were subjected to LTLH and HTHH conditions for 3 days. This was followed by a 4-day heat stress phase and then by a 7-day phase of heat stress, which were complemented by supplementation with rumen-protected L-tryptophan (ACT). The findings revealed that supplementation with ACT increased dry matter intake as well as milk yield and protein and decreased water intake, heart rate, and rectal temperature in the HTHH group (p < 0.05). For plateletcrit (PCT, p = 0.0600), the eosinophil percentage (EOS, p = 0.0880) showed a tendency to be lower, while the monocyte (MONO) and large unstained cells (LUC) amounts were increased in both groups (p < 0.05). Albumin and glucose levels were lower in the HTHH group (p < 0.05). The gene expressions of heat shock proteins 70 and 90 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher in the ACT group (HTHH, p < 0.05). These results suggest that ACT supplementation improved productivity, physiological indicators, blood characteristics, and gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of early lactating Holstein cows under heat-stress conditions. In particular, ACT supplementation objectively relieved stress in these animals, suggesting that L-tryptophan has potential as a viable solution for combating heat-stress-induced effects on the cattle in dairy farming.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816680', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021217', 'CorpusId': 267058362, 'PubMed': '38279240'}",1,"Given that heat stress negatively impacts the productivity and physiological health of lactating Holstein cows, our research proposes investigating the efficacy of rumen-protected L-tryptophan (ACT) supplementation as a mitigative strategy.

Therefore, investigations into the impact of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids (FAs) on human body homeostasis are crucial for understanding the development of lifestyle diseases. In this paper, we focus on the impact of palmitic (PA), linoleic (LA), and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids on human colon normal (CCD-18 Co) and cancer (Caco-2) single cells using Raman imaging and spectroscopy. The label-free nature of Raman imaging allowed us to evaluate FAs dynamics without modifying endogenous cellular metabolism. Thanks to the ability of Raman imaging to visualize single-cell substructures, we have analyzed the changes in chemical composition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, lipid droplets (LDs), and nucleus upon FA supplementation. Analysis of Raman band intensity ratios typical for lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (I1656/I1444, I1444/I1256, I1444/I750, I1304/I1256) proved that, using Raman mapping, we can observe the metabolic pathways of FAs in ER, which is responsible for the uptake of exogenous FAs, de novo synthesis, elongation, and desaturation of FAs, in mitochondria responsible for energy production via FA oxidation, in LDs specialized in cellular fat storage, and in the nucleus, where FAs are transported via fatty-acid-binding proteins, biomarkers of human colon cancerogenesis. Analysis for membranes showed that the uptake of FAs effectively changed the chemical composition of this organelle, and the strongest effect was noticed for LA. The spectroscopy studies have been completed using XTT tests, which showed that the addition of LA or EPA for Caco-2 cells decreases their viability with a stronger effect observed for LA and the opposite effect observed for PA. For normal cells, CCD-18 Co supplementation using LA or EPA stimulated cells for growing, while PA had the opposite impact.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050638', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084508', 'CorpusId': 269311050, 'PubMed': '38674093'}",1,"Given that altered lipid metabolism significantly influences the development of diseases such as cancer, this study investigates the effects of palmitic (PA), linoleic (LA), and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids on normal and cancerous human colon cells using advanced Raman imaging and spectroscopy.

In the era of microbial resistance, probiotic strains or their metabolic products are emerging as an innovative approach for the treatment of hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds due to their antimicrobial, healing, and host immune-modulatory effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of cell-free supernatants (CFS) from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG against mono- and dual-species biofilms of wound pathogens in a 3D in vitro infection model. Mature biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were obtained on collagen scaffolds in the presence of a simulant wound fluid (SWF) and treated with CFS at different doses and time intervals. At 1:4 dilution in SWF, CFS caused a marked reduction in the colony forming-unit (CFU) numbers of bacteria embedded in mono-species biofilms as well as bacteria released by the biofilms in the supernatant. CFU count and electron microscopy imaging also demonstrated a marked antibiofilm effect against dual-species biofilms starting from 8 h of incubation. Furthermore, CFS exhibited acceptable levels of cytotoxicity at 24 h of incubation against HaCaT cells and, differently from ciprofloxacin, failed to induce resistance after 15 passages at sub-inhibitory concentrations. Overall, the results obtained point to L. rhamnosus GG postbiotics as a promising strategy for the treatment of wound biofilms.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10888627', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042087', 'CorpusId': 267592277, 'PubMed': '38396764'}",1,"Given that microbial biofilms significantly contribute to infection and impede the healing of chronic wounds, this study explores the efficacy of cell-free supernatants (CFS) from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG as a novel therapeutic approach.

Telomere attrition has been associated with infertility, DNA damage and fragmentation. Oxidative stress has been shown to affect sperm DNA integrity and telomere length. Sirtuins such as SIRT1 and SIRT3 are involved in aging and oxidative stress response. The aim of the present study is to determine the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in regulating oxidative stress, telomere shortening, and their association with oligospermia. Therefore, we assessed the protein levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase activity (CAT) in the seminal plasma of 272 patients with oligospermia and 251 fertile men. We also measured sperm telomere length (STL) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) using a standard real-time quantitative PCR assay. Sperm chromatin and protamine deficiency were also measured as per standard methods. Our results for oligospermic patients demonstrate significant reductions in semen parameters, shorter STL and LTL, lower levels of SOD, TAC, CAT, SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels, and also significant protamine deficiency and higher levels of MDA and DNA fragmentation. We conclude that a shorter TL in sperms and leukocytes is associated with increased oxidative stress that also accounts for high levels of DNA fragmentation in sperms. Our results support the hypothesis that various sperm parameters in the state of oligospermia are associated with or caused by reduced levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 proteins.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10815409', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25020718', 'CorpusId': 266799733, 'PubMed': '38255792'}",1,"Given that infertility impacts millions of couples globally, with oxidative stress and telomere attrition being key factors in sperm DNA damage and oligospermia, this study explores the roles of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in these processes.

After harvest, these tubers will undergo a period of dormancy. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a new class of plant hormones that regulate plant growth and seed germination. In this study, 500 nM of BR was able to break the dormancy of tubers. Additionally, exogenous BR also upregulated BR signal transduction genes, except for StBIN2. StBIN2 is a negative regulator of BR, but its specific role in tuber dormancy remains unclear. Transgenic methods were used to regulate the expression level of StBIN2 in tubers. It was demonstrated that the overexpression of StBIN2 significantly prolonged tuber dormancy while silencing StBIN2 led to premature sprouting. To further investigate the effect of StBIN2 on tuber dormancy, RNA-Seq was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes in OE-StBIN2, RNAi-StBIN2, and WT tubers. The results showed that StBIN2 upregulated the expression of ABA signal transduction genes but inhibited the expression of lignin synthesis key genes. Meanwhile, it was also found that StBIN2 physically interacted with StSnRK2.2 and StCCJ9. These results indicate that StBIN2 maintains tuber dormancy by mediating ABA signal transduction and lignin synthesis. The findings of this study will help us better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying potato tuber dormancy and provide theoretical support for the development of new varieties using related genes.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10889842', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042244', 'CorpusId': 267687746, 'PubMed': '38396922'}",1,"Given that brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones known to regulate plant growth and seed germination, this study investigates their role in breaking potato tuber dormancy.

Although GO is generally considered biocompatible, it can negatively impact cell physiology under some circumstances. Here, we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of GO greatly varies depending on the cell adhesion states. Human HCT-116 cells in a non-adhered state were more susceptible to GO than those in an adherent state. Apoptosis was partially induced by GO in both adhered and non-adhered cells to a similar extent, suggesting that apoptosis induction does not account for the selective effects of GO on non-adhered cells. GO treatment rapidly decreased intracellular ATP levels in non-adhered cells but not in adhered ones, suggesting ATP depletion as the primary cause of GO-induced cell death. Concurrently, autophagy induction, a cellular response for energy homeostasis, was more evident in non-adhered cells than in adhered cells. Collectively, our observations provide novel insights into GO’s action with regard to cell adhesion states. Because the elimination of non-adhered cells is important in preventing cancer metastasis, the selective detrimental effects of GO on non-adhered cells suggest its therapeutic potential for use in cancer metastasis.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855874', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031927', 'CorpusId': 267511159, 'PubMed': '38339205'}",1,"Given that graphene oxide (GO) exhibits varying levels of cytotoxicity depending on the adhesion state of cells, our research proposes to investigate the mechanistic pathways through which GO selectively affects non-adhered cells more severely than adhered cells.

Additionally, autophagy, a cellular mechanism for maintaining energy homeostasis, is more prominently induced in non-adhered cells following GO treatment. These insights suggest that GO could be leveraged therapeutically to target non-adhered cells, potentially offering a novel strategy for preventing cancer metastasis by eliminating these cells more effectively."

It also poses detrimental impacts on the developmental capacity of bovine budding oocytes, which halt their fertility. To mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms through which it affects the developmental capacity of oocytes. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the impact of heat stress on the epigenetic modifications in bovine oocytes and embryos, as well as on oocyte developmental capacity, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, transzonal projections, and gene expression levels. Our results showed that heat stress significantly reduced the expression levels of the epigenetic modifications from histone H1, histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H4, DNA methylation, and DNA hydroxymethylation at all stages of the oocyte and embryo. Similarly, heat stress significantly reduced cleavage rate, blastocyst rate, oocyte mitochondrial-membrane potential level, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) level, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and transzonal projection level. It was also found that heat stress affected mitochondrial distribution in oocytes and significantly increased reactive oxygen species, apoptosis levels and mitochondrial autophagy levels.

Herein, we report an alternative CAR design that incorporates transmembrane domains with the ability to recruit endogenous signaling molecules, eliminating the need for stimulatory signals within the CAR structure. These endogenous signaling molecule activating (ESMA) CARs triggered robust cytotoxic activity and proliferation of the T cells when directed against the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 while exhibiting reduced cytokine secretion and exhaustion marker expression compared to their cognate standard second generation CARs. In a NOD SCID Gamma (NSG) MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model, the lead candidate maintained longitudinal therapeutic efficacy and an enhanced T cell memory phenotype.

Although BC has been studied as a dressing material for cutaneous wounds, to date, BC inherently lacks antibacterial properties. The current research utilizes bifunctional chimeric peptides containing carbohydrate binding peptides (CBP; either a short version or a long version) and an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), KR-12. The secondary structure of the chimeric peptides was evaluated and confirmed that the α-helix structure of KR-12 was retained for both chimeric peptides evaluated (Long-CBP-KR12 and Short-CBP-KR12). Chimeric peptides and their individual components were assessed for cytotoxicity, where only higher concentrations of Short-CBP and longer timepoints of Short-CBP-KR12 exposure exhibited negative effects on metabolic activity, which was attributed to solubility issues. All KR-12-containing peptides exhibited antibacterial activity in solution against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding capability of the peptides was evaluated and the Short-CBP-KR12 peptide exhibited enhanced LPS-binding capabilities compared to KR-12 alone. Both chimeric peptides were able to bind to BC and were observed to be retained on the surface over a 7-day period. All functionalized materials exhibited no adverse effects on the metabolic activity of both normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human epidermal keratinocyte (HaCaT) epithelial cells. Additionally, the BC tethered chimeric peptides exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli.

We report on a microporous scaffold implant as a minimally invasive immunological niche to assay rejection before graft injury. Adoptive transfer of T cells into Rag2−/− mice with mismatched allografts induced acute cellular allograft rejection (ACAR), with subsequent validation in wild-type animals. Following murine heart or skin transplantation, scaffold implants accumulate predominantly innate immune cells. The scaffold enables frequent biopsy, and gene expression analyses identified biomarkers of ACAR before clinical signs of graft injury. This gene signature distinguishes ACAR and immunodeficient respiratory infection before injury onset, indicating the specificity of the biomarkers to differentiate ACAR from other inflammatory insult.

This capability empowers individuals to effectively manage their daily diet and nutrition using devices such as smartphones. In this study, we propose an Efficient Hybrid Food Recognition Net (EHFR–Net), a novel neural network that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). We find that in the context of food-image recognition tasks, while ViT demonstrates superiority in extracting global information, its approach of disregarding the initial spatial information hampers its efficacy. Therefore, we designed a ViT method termed Location-Preserving Vision Transformer (LP–ViT), which retains positional information during the global information extraction process. To ensure the lightweight nature of the model, we employ an inverted residual block on the CNN side to extract local features. Global and local features are seamlessly integrated by directly summing and concatenating the outputs from the convolutional and ViT structures, resulting in the creation of a unified Hybrid Block (HBlock) in a coherent manner. Moreover, we optimize the hierarchical layout of EHFR–Net to accommodate the unique characteristics of HBlock, effectively reducing the model size. Our extensive experiments on three well-known food image-recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For instance, on the ETHZ Food–101 dataset, our method achieves an outstanding recognition accuracy of 90.7%, which is 3.5% higher than the state-of-the-art ViT-based lightweight network MobileViTv2 (87.2%), which has an equivalent number of parameters and calculations.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10819383', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16020200', 'CorpusId': 266888212, 'PubMed': '38257093'}",1,"Given that food-image recognition is essential for intelligent nutrition management, particularly through mobile devices, I propose developing a novel and efficient hybrid neural network that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) methodologies.

The mechanism by which Rif2 restrains Tel1 activation and the consequences of this inhibition at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are poorly understood. In this study, we employed AlphaFold-Multimer modelling to pinpoint and validate the interaction surface between Rif2 MIN and Rad50. We also engineered the rif2-S6E mutation that enhances the inhibitory effect of Rif2 by increasing Rif2-Rad50 interaction. Unlike rif2Δ, the rif2-S6E mutation impairs hairpin cleavage. Furthermore, it diminishes Tel1 activation by inhibiting Tel1 binding to DSBs while leaving MRX association unchanged, indicating that Rif2 can directly inhibit Tel1 recruitment to DSBs. Additionally, Rif2S6E reduces Tel1-MRX interaction and increases stimulation of ATPase by Rad50, indicating that Rif2 binding to Rad50 induces an ADP-bound MRX conformation that is not suitable for Tel1 binding. The decreased Tel1 recruitment to DSBs in rif2-S6E cells impairs DSB end-tethering and this bridging defect is suppressed by expressing a Tel1 mutant variant that increases Tel1 persistence at DSBs, suggesting a direct role for Tel1 in the bridging of DSB ends.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10954470', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkad1246', 'CorpusId': 266787575, 'PubMed': '38180815'}",1,"Given that the yeast Rif2 protein inhibits Mre11 nuclease and Tel1 kinase activation through the MIN motif by binding to Rad50 and simulating its ATPase activity, the exact mechanisms and consequences of this inhibition at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) remain unclear.

Despite their practical success, no consensus exists regarding the mechanisms underlying well-established hypnotic phenomena. Here, we suggest a new framework called the Simulation-Adaptation Theory of Hypnosis (SATH). SATH expands the predictive coding framework by focusing on (a) redundancy elimination in generative models using intrinsically generated prediction errors, (b) adaptation due to amplified or prolonged neural activity, and (c) using internally generated predictions as a venue for learning new associations. The core of our treatise is that simulating proprioceptive, interoceptive, and exteroceptive signals, along with the top-down attenuation of the precision of sensory prediction errors due to neural adaptation, can explain objective and subjective hypnotic phenomena. Based on these postulations, we offer mechanistic explanations for critical categories of direct verbal suggestions, including (1) direct-ideomotor, (2) challenge-ideomotor, (3) perceptual, and (4) cognitive suggestions. Notably, we argue that besides explaining objective responses, SATH accounts for the subjective effects of suggestions, i.e., the change in the sense of agency and reality. Finally, we discuss individual differences in hypnotizability and how SATH accommodates them. We believe that SATH is exhaustive and parsimonious in its scope, can explain a wide range of hypnotic phenomena without contradiction, and provides a host of testable predictions for future research.",2024,Frontiers in Psychology,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11223671', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1388347', 'CorpusId': 270646924, 'PubMed': '38966744'}",1,"Given that hypnosis is an effective clinical intervention with unclear underlying mechanisms, we propose a research hypothesis based on the newly suggested Simulation-Adaptation Theory of Hypnosis (SATH).

Recent studies focusing on the RBP interactomes of viral mRNAs, notably SARS-Cov-2, have revealed both similarities and differences between the RBP profiles of viral and cellular mRNAs. However, the RBPome of influenza virus mRNAs remains unexplored. Herein, we identify RBPs that associate with the viral mRNA encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) of an influenza A virus. Focusing on TDP-43, we show that it binds several influenza mRNAs beyond the NP-mRNA, and that its depletion results in lower levels of viral mRNAs and proteins within infected cells, and a decreased yield of infectious viral particles. We provide evidence that the viral polymerase recruits TDP-43 onto viral mRNAs through a direct interaction with the disordered C-terminal domain of TDP-43. Notably, other RBPs found to be associated with influenza virus mRNAs also interact with the viral polymerase, which points to a role of the polymerase in orchestrating the assembly of viral messenger ribonucleoproteins.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11229366', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae291', 'CorpusId': 269483229, 'PubMed': '38686810'}",1,"Given that genome-wide studies have expanded our understanding of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interacting with eukaryotic cellular polyadenylated mRNAs and highlighted differences in RBP profiles between viral and cellular mRNAs, my research will explore the RBPome of influenza virus mRNAs.

My hypothesis is that the influenza viral polymerase plays a central role in recruiting and orchestrating the assembly of specific RBPs to enhance viral mRNA stability and translation, ultimately boosting viral replication and pathogenicity. By investigating the interactions between influenza viral polymerase and various RBPs, we aim to uncover potential therapeutic targets for antiviral strategies."

The clinicopathological significance of CDK2 in ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancers (BCs) remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated CDK2’s protein expression in 479 BC samples and 216 DCIS specimens. Analysis of CDK2 transcripts was completed in the METABRIC cohort (n = 1980) and TCGA cohort (n = 1090), respectively. A high nuclear CDK2 protein expression was significantly associated with aggressive phenotypes, including a high tumour grade, lymph vascular invasion, a poor Nottingham prognostic index (all p-values < 0.0001), and shorter survival (p = 0.006), especially in luminal BC (p = 0.009). In p53-mutant BC, high nuclear CDK2 remained linked with worse survival (p = 0.01). In DCIS, high nuclear/low cytoplasmic co-expression showed significant association with a high tumour grade (p = 0.043), triple-negative and HER2-enriched molecular subtypes (p = 0.01), Comedo necrosis (p = 0.024), negative ER status (p = 0.004), negative PR status (p < 0.0001), and a high proliferation index (p < 0.0001). Tumours with high CDK2 transcripts were more likely to have higher expressions of genes involved in the cell cycle, homologous recombination, and p53 signaling.

This study found significant associations between high CDK2 expression and adverse tumor characteristics, such as higher tumor grade, lymph vascular invasion, and reduced survival rates, particularly in luminal and p53-mutant breast cancers. Additionally, in ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), high nuclear CDK2 expression correlated with markers of aggressiveness, including triple-negative and HER2-enriched subtypes, and high proliferation indices. These findings suggest that targeting CDK2 with specific inhibitors could potentially improve clinical outcomes for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer and aggressive DCIS."

The efficacy of anti-RV vaccines is limited in underdeveloped countries, emphasizing the need for novel strategies to boost immunity and alleviate RV-induced diarrhea. This study explores the effectiveness of interventions involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) from probiotic and commensal E. coli in mitigating diarrhea and enhancing immunity in a preclinical model of RV infection in suckling rats. On days 8 and 16 of life, variables related to humoral and cellular immunity and intestinal function/architecture were assessed. Both interventions enhanced humoral (serum immunoglobulins) and cellular (splenic natural killer (NK), cytotoxic T (Tc) and positive T-cell receptor γδ (TCRγδ) cells) immunity against viral infections and downregulated the intestinal serotonin receptor-3 (HTR3). However, certain effects were strain-specific. EcoR12 EVs activated intestinal CD68, TLR2 and IL-12 expression, whereas EcN EVs improved intestinal maturation, barrier properties (goblet cell numbers/mucin 2 expression) and absorptive function (villus length). In conclusion, interventions involving probiotic/microbiota EVs may serve as a safe postbiotic strategy to improve clinical symptoms and immune responses during RV infection in the neonatal period. Furthermore, they could be used as adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of anti-RV vaccines.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816611', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021184', 'CorpusId': 267092515, 'PubMed': '38256253'}",1,"Given that rotavirus (RV) infection remains a significant cause of acute gastroenteritis in children under 5, particularly in low-income countries where current vaccines show limited efficacy, our research proposes investigating the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from probiotic and commensal E. coli as a novel therapeutic strategy. The study reveals that these EVs can enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses and improve intestinal function in a preclinical model of RV infection in suckling rats.

To identify additional regions containing conserved structures, we utilized a multiple sequence alignment with related coronaviruses as a starting point. We applied a computational pipeline developed for identifying non-coding RNA elements. Our pipeline employed three different RNA structural prediction approaches. We identified forty genomic regions likely to harbor structures, with ten of them showing three-way consensus substructure predictions among our predictive utilities. We conducted intracomparisons of the predictive utilities within the pipeline and intercomparisons with four previously published SARS-CoV-2 structural datasets. While there was limited agreement on the precise structure, different approaches seemed to converge on regions likely to contain structures in the viral genome. By comparing and combining various computational approaches, we can predict regions most likely to form structures, as well as a probable structure or ensemble of structures. These predictions can be used to guide surveillance, prophylactic measures, or therapeutic efforts.

FAB-M4/M5 patients are heterogeneous with regard to genetic abnormalities, even though monocytic differentiation is common for patients with Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) insertions/mutations; to further study the heterogeneity of FAB-M4/M5 patients we did a proteomic and phosphoproteomic comparison of FAB-M4/M5 patients with (n = 13) and without (n = 12) NPM1 mutations. The proteomic profile of NPM1-mutated FAB-M4/M5 patients was characterized by increased levels of proteins involved in the regulation of endocytosis/vesicle trafficking/organellar communication. In contrast, AML cells without NPM1 mutations were characterized by increased levels of several proteins involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic translation, including a large number of ribosomal proteins. The phosphoproteomic differences between the two groups were less extensive but reflected similar differences. To conclude, even though FAB classification/monocytic differentiation are associated with differences in responsiveness to new targeted therapies (e.g., Bcl-2 inhibition), our results shows that FAB-M4/M5 patients are heterogeneous with regard to important biological characteristics of the leukemic cells.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11121526', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25105080', 'CorpusId': 269669578, 'PubMed': '38791118'}",1,"Hypothesis: Given that monocytic differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), classified as FAB subtypes M4/M5, is associated with differential responsiveness to targeted therapies such as Bcl-2 and potentially bromodomain inhibition, there exists significant heterogeneity in the biological characteristics of these leukemic cells.

Proteomic analyses reveal that NPM1-mutated FAB-M4/M5 AML cells exhibit increased levels of proteins related to endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and organellar communication, whereas non-mutated cells show elevated levels of proteins involved in cytoplasmic translation, including numerous ribosomal proteins. Phosphoproteomic differences, although less extensive, align with these proteomic distinctions. These findings underscore the importance of considering biological variability within FAB-M4/M5 patients when evaluating their responsiveness to targeted therapies."

Linear regression models were used to validate the effects of nutrition and exercise on cognitive function and to test their interaction effects with happiness. When the interactions were significant, stratified analyses in sub-groups were conducted. Mediation effects of happiness were examined using two-step causal mediation models. We confirmed that better nutrition (p < 0.001) and exercise (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with less cognitive decline. Furthermore, the effects of nutrition and exercise on cognitive decline were significant in the unhappy (happiness < 20) (p < 0.001) and younger (age < 74) sub-groups (p = 0.015). Happiness partially mediated 11.5% of the negative association of cognitive decline with nutrition (p = 0.015) and 23.0% of that with exercise (p = 0.017). This study suggests that happiness moderates and partially mediates the effects of exercise and nutrition on cognitive status.

In a rat MTJ defect model, the bioactive fiber-reinforced hydrogel promoted the structural restoration of muscle, tendon, and muscle-tendon interface and enhanced the functional recovery of injured MTJ. In vivo proteomics and in vitro cell cultures elucidated the regenerative mechanisms of the bioactive fiber-reinforced hydrogel by modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, thus engineering an optimized microenvironment to support the survival and differentiation of transplanted MSCs and maintain the functional phenotype of resident cells within MTJ tissues, including tendon/muscle cells and macrophages.

PD has duplicated its global burden in the last few years, becoming the leading neurological disability worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches that target multifactorial underlying causes to potentially prevent or limit disease progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammatory responses may play a pivotal role in the neurodegenerative processes that occur during the development of PD. Cortistatin is a neuropeptide that has shown potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects in preclinical models of autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders. The goal of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential of cortistatin in a well-established preclinical mouse model of PD induced by acute exposure to the neurotoxin 1-methil-4-phenyl1-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We observed that treatment with cortistatin mitigated the MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and their connections to the striatum. Consequently, cortistatin administration improved the locomotor activity of animals intoxicated with MPTP. In addition, cortistatin diminished the presence and activation of glial cells in the affected brain regions of MPTP-treated mice, reduced the production of immune mediators, and promoted the expression of neurotrophic factors in the striatum. In an in vitro model of PD, treatment with cortistatin also demonstrated a reduction in the cell death of dopaminergic neurons that were exposed to the neurotoxin. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortistatin could emerge as a promising new therapeutic agent that combines anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties to regulate the progression of PD at multiple levels.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10815070', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25020694', 'CorpusId': 266793992, 'PubMed': '38255772'}",1,"Given that Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a leading neurological disability characterized by the impairment of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and is influenced by neuroinflammatory processes, there is a critical need for innovative therapeutic approaches.

BoDV-1 also establishes persistent infection in neuronal cells and causes neurobehavioral abnormalities. Once neuronal cells or normal neural networks are lost by BoDV-1 infection, it is difficult to regenerate damaged neural networks. Therefore, the development of efficient anti-BoDV-1 treatments is important to improve the outcomes of the infection. Recently, one of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems, CRISPR/Cas13, has been utilized as antiviral tools. However, it is still unrevealed whether the CRISPR/Cas13 system can suppress RNA viruses in persistently infected cells. In this study, we addressed this question using persistently BoDV-1-infected cells. The CRISPR/Cas13 system targeting viral mRNAs efficiently decreased the levels of target viral mRNAs and genomic RNA (gRNA) in persistently infected cells. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas13 system targeting viral mRNAs also suppressed BoDV-1 infection if the system was introduced prior to the infection. Collectively, we demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas13 system can suppress BoDV-1 in both acute and persistent infections.

PEG and PDS chemicals have been widely applied for promoting the folding of in vivo or in vitro G4s. However, how PEG and PDS preferentially affect a subset of G4 formation genome-wide is still largely unknown. We here conducted a BG4-based IP-seq in vitro under K++PEG or K++PDS conditions in the rice genome. We found that PEG-favored IP-G4s+ have distinct sequence features, distinct genomic distributions and distinct associations with TEGs, non-TEGs and subtypes of TEs compared to PDS-favored ones. Strikingly, PEG-specific IP-G4s+ are associated with euchromatin with less enrichment levels of DNA methylation but with more enriched active histone marks, while PDS-specific IP-G4s+ are associated with heterochromatin with higher enrichment levels of DNA methylation and repressive marks. Moreover, we found that genes with PEG-specific IP-G4s+ are more expressed than those with PDS-specific IP-G4s+, suggesting that PEG/PDS-specific IP-G4s+ alone or coordinating with epigenetic marks are involved in the regulation of the differential expression of related genes, therefore functioning in distinct biological processes. Thus, our study provides new insights into differential impacts of PEG and PDS on G4 formation, thereby advancing our understanding of G4 biology.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10779103', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25010634', 'CorpusId': 266801478, 'PubMed': '38203805'}",1,"Given that G-quadruplexes (G4s) play critical roles in various genomic processes within eukaryotic cells, understanding how specific chemicals like PEG and PDS influence their formation is vital.

The findings revealed that PEG and PDS promote the formation of different subsets of G4s, which exhibit unique sequence characteristics, genomic distributions, and associations with transcriptionally active or repressive chromatin states. Specifically, PEG-favored G4s are linked to euchromatin and active histone marks, while PDS-favored G4s are associated with heterochromatin and repressive epigenetic marks. Furthermore, genes associated with PEG-specific G4s show higher expression levels compared to those with PDS-specific G4s, indicating that these chemicals may regulate gene expression through their differential effects on G4 formation and epigenetic landscapes. This research advances our understanding of the nuanced roles of PEG and PDS in G4 biology and their potential implications in gene regulation."

Long-lasting changes in DNA methylation—a chemical mark deposited on DNA that can affect gene activity—have been hypothesized to contribute to early-life effects. But evidence for persistent, early environment-associated differences in DNA methylation is lacking in wild animals. Here, we show that early-life adversity in wild baboons predicts DNA methylation levels in adulthood, especially for animals born in low-resource environments and drought conditions. We also show that some of the changes we observe in DNA methylation have the capacity to influence gene activity levels.

315,6f124bc2e3ae2c80def93ece2c367e6820bdebd2,The Effects of Caloric Restriction on Inflammatory Targets in the Prostates of Aged Rats,"Numerous animal models have demonstrated that caloric restriction (CR) is an excellent tool to delay aging and increase the quality of life, likely because it counteracts age-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. The aging process can affect the prostate in three ways: the onset of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer. In this study, we used 14 aged male Sprague Dawley rats, which were allocated into two groups, at the age of 18 months old. One group was fed ad libitum (a normal diet (ND)), and the other group followed a caloric restriction diet with a 60% decrease in intake. The rats were sacrificed at the age of 24 months. By immunohistochemical (IHC) and Western blot (WB) analyses, we studied the variations between the two groups in immune inflammation and fibrosis-related markers in aged prostate tissues. Morphological examinations showed lower levels of prostatic hyperplasia and fibrosis in the CR rats vs. the ND rats. The IHC results revealed that the prostates of the CR rats exhibited a lower immune proinflammatory infiltrate level and a reduced expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, together with significantly reduced expressions of mesenchymal markers and the profibrotic factor TGFβ1. Finally, by WB analysis, we observed a reduced expression of ERα, which is notoriously implicated in prostate stromal proliferation, and increased expressions of SOD1 and Hsp70, both exerting protective effects against oxidative stress. Overall, these data suggest that CR brings potential benefits to prostatic tissues as it reduces the physiological immune–inflammatory processes and the tissue remodeling caused by aging.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11120753', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25105236', 'CorpusId': 269834468, 'PubMed': '38791274'}",1,"Given that caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to delay aging and improve life quality by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in various animal models, this study proposes that CR could also positively impact aging-related changes in the prostate.

Though population structure and phylogenetic studies have been conducted on a large group of alfalfa nuclear genomes, information about the chloroplast genomes is still lacking. Chloroplast genomes are generally considered to be conservative and play an important role in population diversity analysis and species adaptation in plants. Here, 231 complete alfalfa chloroplast genomes were successfully assembled from 359 alfalfa resequencing data, on the basis of which the alfalfa chloroplast pan-genome was constructed. We investigated the genetic variations of the alfalfa chloroplast genome through comparative genomic, genetic diversity, phylogenetic, population genetic structure, and haplotype analysis. Meanwhile, the expression of alfalfa chloroplast genes under cold stress was explored through transcriptome analysis. As a result, chloroplast genomes of 231 alfalfa lack an IR region, and the size of the chloroplast genome ranges from 125,192 bp to 126,105 bp. Using population structure, haplotypes, and construction of a phylogenetic tree, it was found that alfalfa populations could be divided into four groups, and multiple highly variable regions were found in the alfalfa chloroplast genome. Transcriptome analysis showed that tRNA genes were significantly up-regulated in the cold-sensitive varieties, while rps7, rpl32, and ndhB were down-regulated, and the editing efficiency of ycf1, ycf2, and ndhF was decreased in the cold-tolerant varieties, which may be due to the fact that chloroplasts store nutrients through photosynthesis to resist cold.

The coordinated action of three catalytic activities of the Csm complex enables simultaneous degradation of the invader's RNA transcripts, destruction of the template DNA and synthesis of signaling molecules (cyclic oligoadenylates cAn) that activate auxiliary proteins to reinforce CRISPR-Cas defense. Here, we employed single-molecule techniques to connect the kinetics of RNA binding, dissociation, and DNA hydrolysis by the Csm complex from Streptococcus thermophilus. Although single-stranded RNA is cleaved rapidly (within seconds), dual-color FCS experiments and single-molecule TIRF microscopy revealed that Csm remains bound to terminal RNA cleavage products with a half-life of over 1 hour while releasing the internal RNA fragments quickly. Using a continuous fluorescent DNA degradation assay, we observed that RNA-regulated single-stranded DNase activity decreases on a similar timescale. These findings suggest that after fast target RNA cleavage the terminal RNA cleavage products stay bound within the Csm complex, keeping the Cas10 subunit activated for DNA destruction. Additionally, we demonstrate that during Cas10 activation, the complex remains capable of RNA turnover, i.e. of ongoing degradation of target RNA.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11040160', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae080', 'CorpusId': 267616537, 'PubMed': '38340341'}",1,"Given that the type III CRISPR-Cas effector complex Csm functions as a versatile defense mechanism against foreign nucleic acids through its coordinated catalytic activities, our research aims to further explore the temporal dynamics and regulatory mechanisms underlying these processes. The study revealed that the Csm complex from Streptococcus thermophilus rapidly cleaves single-stranded RNA, but remains bound to terminal RNA cleavage products for an extended period, maintaining the activation of its Cas10 subunit for DNA degradation. This persistent binding suggests a sustained defensive state while allowing continuous RNA turnover. Building on these findings, we propose to investigate the potential regulatory factors and molecular interactions that modulate the prolonged activation of the Csm complex and its implications for enhancing CRISPR-Cas defense efficacy."

We investigated the role of LHFPL5 by measuring MET channel activation curves and hair bundle stiffness in OHCs of wild-type mice and Lhfpl5 mutants.

The adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) rodent model mimics human adolescent binge drinking and has identified the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NbM) as a key site of pathology. The NbM is a critical regulator of prefrontal cortical (PFC) cholinergic function and attention. The cholinergic phenotype is controlled pro/mature neurotrophin receptor activation. We sought to determine if p75NTR activity contributes to the loss of cholinergic phenotype in AIE by using a p75NTR modulator (LM11A-31) to inhibit prodegenerative signaling during ethanol exposure. Male and female rats underwent 5 g/kg ethanol (AIE) or water (CON) exposure following 2-day-on 2-day-off cycles from postnatal day 25–57. A subset of these groups also received a protective dose of LM11A-31 (50 mg/kg) during adolescence. Rats were trained on a sustained attention task (SAT) and behaviorally relevant acetylcholine (ACh) activity was recorded in the PFC with a fluorescent indicator (AChGRAB 3.0). AIE produced learning deficits on the SAT, which were spared with LM11A-31. In addition, PFC ACh activity was blunted by AIE, which LM11A-31 corrected. Investigation of NbM ChAT+ and TrkA+ neuronal expression found that AIE led to a reduction of ChAT+TrkA+ neurons, which again LM11A-31 protected. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the p75NTR activity during AIE treatment is a key regulator of cholinergic degeneration.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11172149', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25115792', 'CorpusId': 270084625, 'PubMed': '38891978'}",1,"Given that adolescent binge alcohol consumption can cause persistent cognitive deficits and increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, this research investigates the role of p75NTR activity in the loss of cholinergic function within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NbM) using an adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) rodent model.

The findings suggest that LM11A-31 effectively mitigates AIE-induced learning deficits, preserves cholinergic activity in the prefrontal cortex, and protects NbM cholinergic neurons from degeneration, implicating p75NTR as a critical factor in alcohol-related cholinergic damage."

Cells lacking BRCA2 display telomeric damage with a subset of these cells bypassing senescence to initiate break-induced replication (BIR) for telomere synthesis. Here we show that the abnormal stabilization of telomeric G4 following BRCA2 depletion leads to telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA)-R-loop accumulation, triggering liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the assembly of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs). Disruption of R-loops abolishes LLPS and impairs telomere synthesis. Artificial engineering of telomeric LLPS restores telomere synthesis, underscoring the critical role of LLPS in ALT. TERRA-R-loops also recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), leading to tri-methylation of Lys27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) at telomeres. Half of paraffin-embedded tissue sections from human breast cancers exhibit APBs and telomere length heterogeneity, suggesting that BRCA2 mutations can predispose individuals to ALT-type tumorigenesis. Overall, BRCA2 abrogation disrupts the dynamicity of telomeric G4, producing TERRA-R-loops, finally leading to the assembly of telomeric liquid condensates crucial for ALT. We propose that modulating the dynamicity of telomeric G4 and targeting TERRA-R-loops in telomeric LLPS maintenance may represent effective therapeutic strategies for treating ALT-like cancers with APBs, including those with BRCA2 disruptions.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11162766', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae251', 'CorpusId': 268998477, 'PubMed': '38587189'}",1,"Given that the dynamic interaction between BRCA2 and telomeric G-quadruplexes is essential for maintaining telomere replication homeostasis, this study reveals that BRCA2 depletion leads to abnormal stabilization of telomeric G4 structures.

In mammalian skeletal muscle precursors, the activity of these channels is still poorly investigated. Here, we characterized TMEM16A channels and investigated if the pharmacological activation of Piezo1 channels could modulate the TMEM16A currents in mouse myogenic precursors. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings combined with the pharmacological agents Ani9, T16inh-A01 and Yoda1 were used to characterize TMEM16A-mediated currents and the possible modulatory effect of Piezo1 activity on TMEM16A channels. Western blot analysis was also carried out to confirm the expression of TMEM16A and Piezo1 channel proteins. We found that TMEM16A channels were functionally expressed in fusion-competent mouse myogenic precursors. The pharmacological blockage of TMEM16A inhibited myocyte fusion into myotubes. Moreover, the specific Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 positively regulated TMEM16A currents. The findings demonstrate, for the first time, a sarcolemmal TMEM16A channel activity and its involvement at the early stage of mammalian skeletal muscle differentiation.

They completed the KIDMED questionnaire to discover their AMD, as well as an anthropometric and physical condition assessment. Results: The findings show that 61.45% had an excellent degree of AMD, 31.25% a moderate one, and 7.30% a poor one. The parameters that most conditioned AMD were the consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, breakfast cereals, and dairy products (p = 0.011–0.000). AMD did not show significant differences in anthropometric characteristics and physical fitness (p = 0.057–0.996).

Building on these findings, we hypothesized that administering a single session of tSCS at multiple spinal segments may yield greater enhancements in muscle strength and gait function during stimulation compared to tSCS at only one or two segments. In our study, tSCS was applied at single segments (C5, L1, and Coc1), two segments (C5-L1, C5-Coc1, and L1-Coc1), or multisegments (C5-L1-Coc1) in a randomized order. We evaluated the 6-m walking test (6MWT) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and assessed the Hmax/Mmax ratio during stimulation in ten individuals with incomplete motor SCI. Our findings indicate that multisegmental tSCS improved walking time and reduced spinal cord excitability, as measured by the Hmax/Mmax ratio, similar to some single or two-site tSCS interventions. However, only multisegmental tSCS resulted in increased tibialis anterior (TA) muscle strength.

However, the resistance mechanism is not yet clear. Our previous studies have shown that GmAP2 enhances sensitivity to P. sojae in soybean, and GmMYB78 is downregulated in the transcriptome analysis of GmAP2-overexpressing transgenic hairy roots. Here, GmMYB78 was significantly induced by P. sojae in susceptible soybean, and the overexpressing of GmMYB78 enhanced sensitivity to the pathogen, while silencing GmMYB78 enhances resistance to P. sojae, indicating that GmMYB78 is a negative regulator of P. sojae. Moreover, the jasmonic acid (JA) content and JA synthesis gene GmAOS1 was highly upregulated in GmMYB78-silencing roots and highly downregulated in overexpressing ones, suggesting that GmMYB78 could respond to P. sojae through the JA signaling pathway. Furthermore, the expression of several pathogenesis-related genes was significantly lower in GmMYB78-overexpressing roots and higher in GmMYB78-silencing ones. Additionally, we screened and identified the upstream regulator GmbHLH122 and downstream target gene GmbZIP25 of GmMYB78. GmbHLH122 was highly induced by P. sojae and could inhibit GmMYB78 expression in resistant soybean, and GmMYB78 was highly expressed to activate downstream target gene GmbZIP25 transcription in susceptible soybean. In conclusion, our data reveal that GmMYB78 triggers soybean sensitivity to P. sojae by inhibiting the JA signaling pathway and the expression of pathogenesis-related genes or through the effects of the GmbHLH122-GmMYB78-GmbZIP25 cascade pathway.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11050205', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084247', 'CorpusId': 269094426, 'PubMed': '38673832'}",1,"Given that Phytophthora root rot severely affects soybean crops, a deeper understanding of its resistance mechanisms is crucial.

The research demonstrates that overexpression of GmMYB78 increases susceptibility to the pathogen, while silencing it enhances resistance, positioning GmMYB78 as a negative regulator. Furthermore, GmMYB78 appears to influence the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, with its silencing leading to higher JA content and upregulation of JA synthesis genes, thereby bolstering resistance. The upstream regulator GmbHLH122 and downstream target gene GmbZIP25 were also identified, forming a cascade that affects GmMYB78 expression. This suggests that manipulating the GmMYB78 pathway could be a strategic approach to improving soybean resistance to Phytophthora root rot."

The chromatin remodeling mechanisms underpinning early meiotic stages remain poorly understood. Here we focus on the function of one of the major autism genes, CHD8, in spermatogenesis, based on the epidemiological association between autism and low fertility rates. Specific ablation of Chd8 in germ cells results in gradual depletion of undifferentiated spermatogonia and the failure of meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation, leading to meiotic prophase I arrest and cell death. Transcriptional analyses demonstrate that CHD8 is required for extensive activation of spermatogenic genes in spermatogonia, necessary for spermatogonial proliferation and meiosis. CHD8 directly binds and regulates genes crucial for meiosis, including H3K4me3 histone methyltransferase genes, meiotic cohesin genes, HORMA domain-containing genes, synaptonemal complex genes, and DNA damage response genes. We infer that CHD8 contributes to meiotic DSB formation and subsequent meiotic progression through combined regulation of these meiosis-related genes.

The [MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ] level characteristics of the π-hole halogen bonds in 33 binary complexes obtained from the charge density approaches (quantum theory of intramolecular atoms, molecular electrostatic surface potential, independent gradient model (IGM-δginter)), intermolecular geometries and energies, and second-order hyperconjugative charge transfer analyses are discussed, which are similar to other non-covalent interactions. That a π-hole can be observed on halogen in halogenated molecules is substantiated by experimentally reported crystals documented in the Cambridge Crystal Structure Database.

AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2 are abortive infection system (Abi) RTs that mediate defense against bacteriophages. What sets Abi RTs apart from other RT enzymes is their ability to synthesize long DNA products of random sequences in a template- and primer-independent manner. Structures of AbiK and Abi-P2 representatives have recently been determined, but there are no structural data available for AbiA. Here, we report the crystal structure of Lactococcus AbiA polymerase in complex with a single-stranded polymerization product. AbiA comprises three domains: an RT-like domain, a helical domain that is typical for Abi polymerases, and a higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain that is common for many antiviral proteins. AbiA forms a dimer that distinguishes it from AbiK and Abi-P2, which form trimers/hexamers. We show the DNA polymerase activity of AbiA in an in vitro assay and demonstrate that it requires the presence of the HEPN domain which is enzymatically inactive. We validate our biochemical and structural results in vivo through bacteriophage infection assays.

Three biochemical and one biophysical assays were developed to enable large-scale screening and hit triaging. The screening funnel, designed to be compatible with high-density microplates, was established with two enzyme inhibition assays employing either fluorescent or absorbance readouts. As IRAP is a zinc-dependent enzyme, the remaining active compounds were further evaluated in the primary assay, albeit with the addition of zinc ions. Rescreening with zinc confirmed the inhibitory activity for most compounds, emphasizing a zinc-independent mechanism of action. Additionally, target engagement was confirmed using a complementary biophysical thermal shift assay where compounds causing positive/negative thermal shifts were considered genuine binders. Triaging based on biochemical activity, target engagement, and drug-likeness resulted in the selection of 50 qualified hits, of which the IC50 of 32 compounds was below 3.5 µM. Despite hydroxamic acid dominance, diverse chemotypes with biochemical activity and target engagement were discovered, including non-hydroxamic acid compounds. The most potent compound (QHL1) was resynthesized with a confirmed inhibitory IC50 of 320 nM.

Empirical observations have led to the misconception that ribosomes are robust protein factories, but in reality, they have several weaknesses. For instance, ribosomes stall during the translation of the proline-rich sequences, but the elongation factor EF-P assists in synthesizing proteins containing the poly-proline sequences. Thus, living organisms have evolved to expand the translation capability of ribosomes through the acquisition of translation elongation factors. In this study, we have revealed that Escherichia coli ATP-Binding Cassette family-F (ABCF) proteins, YheS, YbiT, EttA and Uup, individually cope with various problematic nascent peptide sequences within the exit tunnel. The correspondence between noncanonical translations and ABCFs was YheS for the translational arrest by nascent SecM, YbiT for poly-basic sequence-dependent stalling and poly-acidic sequence-dependent intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD), EttA for IRD at the early stage of elongation, and Uup for poly-proline-dependent stalling. Our results suggest that ATP hydrolysis-coupled structural rearrangement and the interdomain linker sequence are pivotal for handling ‘hard-to-translate’ nascent peptides.

The findings reveal that these ABCF proteins individually manage specific types of translational stalling, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis-coupled structural rearrangement and the interdomain linker sequence are crucial for resolving issues with 'hard-to-translate' peptides.

However, achieving this balance is challenging, as reducing water loss through stomatal pores often hampers CO2 uptake and compromises plant growth. In this study, we found that mutants lacking the ROP9 molecular switch exhibit enhanced water use efficiency without yield penalties, both in greenhouse and large-scale field experiments. The ROP9 switch regulates the formation of reactive oxygen species, and its absence in rop9 mutants leads to elevated stomata ROS levels and increased stomatal closure. Our findings highlight the role of the ROP switch in stomatal function and suggest its potential as a target for improving water use efficiency in crops.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10823239', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2309006120', 'CorpusId': 266872890, 'PubMed': '38190516'}",1,"Given that improving water use efficiency in crops is critical under global warming conditions, our research will investigate the role of the ROP9 molecular switch in regulating stomatal function and its potential to enhance water use efficiency without compromising yield.

Treatment options are limited and rely on a narrow window of opportunity. Apoptosis inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in improving neuronal cell survival in animal models of stroke. However, many inhibitors non-specifically target apoptosis pathways and high doses are needed for treatment. We explored the use of a novel caspase-3/7 inhibitor, New World Laboratories (NWL) 283, with a lower IC50 than current caspase-3/7 inhibitors. We performed in vitro and in vivo assays to determine the efficacy of NWL283 in modulating cell death in a preclinical model of stroke. In vitro and in vivo assays show that NWL283 enhances cell survival of neural precursor cells. Delivery of NWL283 following stroke enhances endogenous NPC migration and leads to increased neurogenesis in the stroke-injured cortex. Furthermore, acute NWL283 administration is neuroprotective at the stroke injury site, decreasing neuronal cell death and reducing microglia activation. Coincident with NWL283 delivery for 8 days, stroke-injured mice exhibited improved functional outcomes that persisted following cessation of the drug. Therefore, we propose that NWL283 is a promising therapeutic warranting further investigation to enhance stroke recovery.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855341', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031786', 'CorpusId': 267456172, 'PubMed': '38339065'}",1,"Given that stroke-induced neuronal cell death leads to significant long-term disabilities and current treatment options are severely limited, this research explores the efficacy of a novel caspase-3/7 inhibitor, NWL283, in improving neuronal survival and functional recovery post-stroke.

This study examined the potential association between energy availability (EA) status and objective sleep quality in 42 male rugby players (mean age: 16.2 ± 0.8 years) during a 7-day follow-up with fixed sleep schedules in the midst of an intensive training phase. Participants’ energy intake was weighed and recorded. Exercise expenditure was estimated using accelerometry. Portable polysomnography devices captured sleep on the last night of the follow-up. Mean EA was 29.3 ± 9.14 kcal·kg FFM−1·day−1, with 47.6% of athletes presenting LEA, 35.7% Reduced Energy Availability (REA), and 16.7% Optimal Energy Availability (OEA). Lower sleep efficiency (SE) and N3 stage proportion, along with higher wake after sleep onset (WASO), were found in participants with LEA compared to those with OEA (p = 0.04, p = 0.03 and p = 0.005, respectively, with large effect sizes). Segmented regression models of the EA-sleep outcomes (SE, sleep onset latency [SOL]), WASO and N3) relationships displayed two separate linear regions and produced a best fit with a breakpoint between 21–33 kcal·kg FFM−1·day−1. Below these thresholds, sleep quality declines considerably.

336,5bf376b09f007897b2196f2ee11cf11b66f2083e,"Origin, evolution, and maintenance of gene-strand bias in bacteria","Abstract Gene-strand bias is a characteristic feature of bacterial genome organization wherein genes are preferentially encoded on the leading strand of replication, promoting co-orientation of replication and transcription. This co-orientation bias has evolved to protect gene essentiality, expression, and genomic stability from the harmful effects of head-on replication-transcription collisions. However, the origin, variation, and maintenance of gene-strand bias remain elusive. Here, we reveal that the frequency of inversions that alter gene orientation exhibits large variation across bacterial populations and negatively correlates with gene-strand bias. The density, distance, and distribution of inverted repeats show a similar negative relationship with gene-strand bias explaining the heterogeneity in inversions. Importantly, these observations are broadly evident across the entire bacterial kingdom uncovering inversions and inverted repeats as primary factors underlying the variation in gene-strand bias and its maintenance. The distinct catalytic subunits of replicative DNA polymerase have co-evolved with gene-strand bias, suggesting a close link between replication and the origin of gene-strand bias. Congruently, inversion frequencies and inverted repeats vary among bacteria with different DNA polymerases. In summary, we propose that the nature of replication determines the fitness cost of replication-transcription collisions, establishing a selection gradient on gene-strand bias by fine-tuning DNA sequence repeats and, thereby, gene inversions.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11040001', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae155', 'CorpusId': 268252323, 'PubMed': '38442257'}",1,"Given that gene-strand bias plays a crucial role in bacterial genome organization by aligning replication and transcription processes to avoid detrimental collisions, our research aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary factors contributing to this bias.

Furthermore, the co-evolution of distinct replicative DNA polymerase subunits with gene-strand bias suggests a fundamental link between replication dynamics and the establishment of gene-strand bias. We hypothesize that the replication machinery determines the fitness cost of replication-transcription collisions, thereby creating a selective pressure that fine-tunes gene-strand bias through the modulation of DNA sequence repeats and gene inversions."

Although epinephrine can restore patients’ hemodynamics, it might also be harmful, supporting the need for adjuvant treatment. We therefore investigated whether NButGT, enhancing O-GlcNAcylation and showing beneficial effects in acute heart failure might improve AS therapy. Ovalbumin-sensitized rats were randomly allocated to six groups: control (CON), shock (AS), shock treated with NButGT alone before (AS+pre-Nbut) or after (AS+post-Nbut) AS onset, shock treated with epinephrine alone (AS+EPI) and shock group treated with combination of epinephrine and NButGT (AS+EPI+preNBut). Induction of shock was performed with an intravenous (IV) ovalbumin. Cardiac protein and cycling enzymes O-GlcNAcylation levels, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, cardiac output (CO), left ventricle shortening fraction (LVSF), mitochondrial respiration, and lactatemia were evaluated using Western blotting experiments, invasive arterial monitoring, echocardiography, mitochondrial oximetry and arterial blood samples. AS decreased MAP (−77%, p < 0.001), CO (−90%, p < 0.001) and LVSF (−30%, p < 0.05). Epinephrine improved these parameters and, in particular, rats did not die in 15 min. But, cardiac mitochondrial respiration remained impaired (complexes I + II −29%, p < 0.05 and II −40%, p < 0.001) with hyperlactatemia. NButGT pretreatment (AS+pre-Nbut) efficiently increased cardiac O-GlcNAcylation level as compared to the AS+post-Nbut group. Compared to epinephrine alone, the adjunction of NButGT significantly improved CO, LVSF and mitochondrial respiration. MAP was not significantly increased but lactatemia decreased more markedly. Pretreatment with NButGT increases O-GlcNAcylation of cardiac proteins and has an additive effect on epinephrine, improving cardiac output and mitochondrial respiration and decreasing blood lactate levels. This new therapy might be useful when the risk of AS cannot be avoided.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970273', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063316', 'CorpusId': 268434667, 'PubMed': '38542290'}",1,"Given that anaphylactic shock (AS) represents a severe acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction with current treatments like epinephrine potentially causing harmful side effects, this study explores the hypothesis that enhancing O-GlcNAcylation with NButGT could improve AS therapy outcomes.

The findings suggest that NButGT, particularly when used in conjunction with epinephrine, significantly enhances cardiac output, left ventricular function, and mitochondrial respiration while reducing blood lactate levels. This indicates that NButGT could serve as an effective adjuvant therapy in managing AS, potentially mitigating some of the risks associated with epinephrine alone."

Although vaccination strategies against FAdV-4 have been adopted, HHS still occurs sporadically. Furthermore, no effective drugs are available for controlling FAdV-4 infection. However, type I and III interferon (IFN) are crucial therapeutic agents against viral infection. The following experiments were conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of chicken IFN against FadV-4. We expressed recombinant chicken type I IFN-α (ChIFN-α) and type III IFN-λ (ChIFN-λ) in Escherichia coli and systemically investigated their antiviral activity against FAdV-4 infection in Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells. ChIFN-α and ChIFN-λ dose dependently inhibited FAdV-4 replication in LMH cells. Compared with ChIFN-λ, ChIFN-α more significantly inhibited viral genome transcription but less significantly suppressed FAdV-4 release. ChIFN-α- and ChIFN-λ-induced IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, such as PKR, ZAP, IRF7, MX1, Viperin, IFIT5, OASL, and IFI6, in LMH cells; however, ChIFN-α induced a stronger expression level than ChIFN-λ.

Moderate-to-severe injuries are associated with blood–brain barrier dysfunction, the development of cerebral oedema, and neuroinflammation. Antagonists of the tachykinin NK1 receptor have been proposed as potential agents for the post-injury treatment of TBI. We report on the identification of EUC-001 as a potential clinical candidate for development as a novel TBI therapy. EUC-001 is a selective NK1 antagonist with a high affinity for the human NK1 receptor (Ki 5.75 × 10−10 M). It has sufficient aqueous solubility to enable intravenous administration, whilst still retaining good CNS penetration as evidenced by its ability to inhibit the gerbil foot-tapping response. Using an animal model of TBI, the post-injury administration of EUC-001 was shown to restore BBB function in a dose-dependent manner. EUC-001 was also able to ameliorate cerebral oedema. These effects were associated with a significant reduction in post-TBI mortality.

The most active cellooligomer for the induction of downstream responses is cellotriose, while cellobiose is around 100 times less effective. These short-chain cellooligomers are also metabolized after uptake into the cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CORK1 is mainly expressed in the vascular tissue of the upper, fully developed part of the roots. Cellooligomer/CORK1-induced responses interfere with chitin-triggered immune responses and are influenced by BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 and the receptor kinase FERONIA. The pathway also controls sugar transporter and metabolism genes and the phosphorylation state of these proteins. Furthermore, cellotriose-induced ROS production and WRKY30/40 expression are controlled by the sugar transporters SUCROSE-PROTON SYMPORTER1, SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTER11 (SWEET11), and SWEET12.

The work was performed on a sample of 1498 women (358 BC patients and 1140 control (non BC) subjects). SHBG correlated in previously GWAS nine polymorphisms such as rs780093 GCKR, rs17496332 PRMT6, rs3779195 BAIAP2L1, rs10454142 PPP1R21, rs7910927 JMJD1C, rs4149056 SLCO1B1, rs440837 ZBTB10, rs12150660 SHBG, and rs8023580 NR2F2 have been genotyped. BC risk effects of allelic and non-allelic SHBG-linked gene SNPs interactions were detected by regression analysis.

Novel treatment strategies for NSCLC are urgently needed. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a tumor suppressor prevalently mutated in NSCLC, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which in turn inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and activates unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) to promote autophagy. Sestrin-2 is a stress-induced protein that enhances LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK, functioning as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. In previous studies, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) extract (RE) activated the AMPK pathway while inhibiting mTORC1 to suppress proliferation, survival, and migration, leading to the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer potential of carnosic acid (CA), a bioactive polyphenolic diterpene compound found in RE. The treatment of H1299 and H460 NSCLC cells with CA resulted in concentration and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation assessed with crystal violet staining and 3H-thymidine incorporation, and concentration-dependent inhibition of survival, assessed using a colony formation assay. Additionally, CA induced apoptosis of H1299 cells as indicated by decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) levels, increased cleaved caspase-3, -7, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) levels, and increased nuclear condensation. These antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects coincided with the upregulation of sestrin-2 and the phosphorylation/activation of LKB1 and AMPK. Downstream of AMPK signaling, CA increased levels of autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3), an established marker of autophagy; inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3MA) blocked the antiproliferative effect of CA. Overall, these data indicate that CA can inhibit NSCLC cell viability and that the underlying mechanism of action of CA involves the induction of autophagy through a Sestrin-2/LKB1/AMPK signaling cascade. Future experiments will use siRNA and small molecule inhibitors to better elucidate the role of these signaling molecules in the mechanism of action of CA as well as tumor xenograft models to assess the anticancer properties of CA in vivo.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10888478', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25041950', 'CorpusId': 267526200, 'PubMed': '38396629'}",1,"Given that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is notably resistant to conventional treatments and has dismal survival rates, there is a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies.

These findings suggest that CA could be a promising candidate for NSCLC therapy, warranting further investigation using siRNA, small molecule inhibitors, and tumor xenograft models to fully elucidate its mechanism of action and in vivo efficacy."

The Syndecan (SDC) family of membrane proteoglycans is known to be involved in the regulation of inflammation, but there is limited evidence considering the role of syndecans in OA synovitis. Our study aimed to investigate the hip OA synovial membrane expression patterns of SDC1, SDC2 and SDC4, as well as exostosins and sulfotransferases (enzymes involved in the polymerisation and modification of syndecans’ heparan sulphate chains). Synovial membrane samples of patients with OA (24) were divided into two groups according to their Krenn synovitis score severity. The immunohistochemical expressions of SDC1, SDC2, SDC4, EXT1, EXT2, NDST1 and NDST2 in synovial intima and subintima were then analysed and compared with the control group (patients with femoral neck fracture). According to our study, the immunoexpression of SDC1, NDST1 and EXT2 is significantly increased in the intimal cells of OA synovial membrane in patients with lower histological synovitis scores and SDC4 in patients with higher synovitis scores, in comparison with non-OA controls. The difference in the expression of SDC2 among the OA and non-OA groups was insignificant. SDC1, SDC4, NDST1 and EXT2 seem to be involved as inflammation moderators in low-grade OA synovitis and, therefore, should be further investigated as potential markers of disease progression and therapeutic goals.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11049902', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25084557', 'CorpusId': 269323995, 'PubMed': '38674142'}",1,"Given that recent studies highlight the importance of low-grade synovitis in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), our research proposes to explore the role of syndecans—specifically SDC1, SDC2, and SDC4—and related enzymes in the inflammatory processes of OA.

Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, Trithorax (SET) was described as a nuclear factor that stimulated transcription from the chromatin template. However, the mechanisms of SET-dependent transcription are unknown. Here, we found that overexpression of SET and CDK9 induced very similar transcriptome signatures in multiple cancer cell lines. SET localized in the transcription start site (TSS)–proximal regions and supported the RNA transcription. SET specifically bound the PP2A-C subunit and induced PP2A-A subunit repulsion from the C subunit, which indicated the role of SET as a PP2A-A/C complex disruptor in the TSS-proximal regions. Through blocking PP2A activity, SET assisted CDK9 to maintain Pol II CTD phosphorylation and activated mRNA transcription.

Additionally, SET disrupts the PP2A-A/C complex in these regions, thereby inhibiting PP2A activity. This inhibition aids CDK9 in sustaining Pol II CTD phosphorylation, which in turn activates mRNA transcription. These findings suggest that SET is a pivotal factor in modulating chromatin PP2A activity, thereby promoting oncogenic transcription in pancreatic cancer."

More than 30% of epilepsies remain intractable, and characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in BBB dysfunction is essential to the identification of new therapeutic strategies. In this work, we induced status epilepticus in rats through injection of the proconvulsant drug pilocarpine, which leads to TLE. Using RT-qPCR, double immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging, we studied the regulation of reactive glia and vascular markers at different time points of epileptogenesis (latent phase—3, 7, and 14 days; chronic phase—1 and 3 months). In the hippocampus, increased expression of mRNA encoding the glial proteins GFAP and Iba1 confirmed neuroinflammatory status. We report for the first time the concomitant induction of the specific proteins CD31, PDGFRβ, and ColIV—which peak at the same time points as inflammation—in the endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane of the BBB. The altered expression of these proteins occurs early in TLE, during the latent phase, suggesting that they could be associated with the early rupture and pathogenicity of the BBB that will contribute to the chronic phase of epilepsy.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855308', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031693', 'CorpusId': 267372527, 'PubMed': '38338969'}",1,"Given that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by hippocampal network reorganization, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, this study explores the molecular underpinnings of BBB disruption in a rat model of induced status epilepticus.

This case (FGR)–control (FGR free) study included 904 women (273 FGR and 631 control) in the third trimester of gestation examined/treated in the Departments of Obstetrics. For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) multiplex genotyping, 50 candidate loci of mAAM were chosen. The relationship of mAAM SNPs and FGR was appreciated by regression procedures (logistic/model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction [MB-MDR]) with subsequent in silico assessment of the assumed functionality pithy of FGR-related loci. Three mAAM-appertain loci were FGR-linked to genes such as KISS1 (rs7538038) (effect allele G-odds ratio (OR)allelic = 0.63/pperm = 0.0003; ORadditive = 0.61/pperm = 0.001; ORdominant = 0.56/pperm = 0.001), NKX2-1 (rs999460) (effect allele A-ORallelic = 1.37/pperm = 0.003; ORadditive = 1.45/pperm = 0.002; ORrecessive = 2.41/pperm = 0.0002), GPRC5B (rs12444979) (effect allele T-ORallelic = 1.67/pperm = 0.0003; ORdominant = 1.59/pperm = 0.011; ORadditive = 1.56/pperm = 0.009). The haplotype ACA FSHB gene (rs555621*rs11031010*rs1782507) was FRG-correlated (OR = 0.71/pperm = 0.05). Ten FGR-implicated interworking models were founded for 13 SNPs (pperm ≤ 0.001). The rs999460 NKX2-1 and rs12444979 GPRC5B interplays significantly influenced the FGR risk (these SNPs were present in 50% of models). FGR-related mAAM-appertain 15 polymorphic variants and 350 linked SNPs were functionally momentous in relation to 39 genes participating in the regulation of hormone levels, the ovulation cycle process, male gonad development and vitamin D metabolism.

We tested the hypothesis that sgp130Fc, which is believed to be a selective IL6 trans-signalling inhibitor, is in fact a non-specific inhibitor of gp130 signalling. In human cancer and primary cells, sgp130Fc inhibited IL6, IL11, OSM and CT1 cis-signalling. The IC50 values of sgp130Fc for IL6 and OSM cis-signalling were markedly (20- to 200-fold) lower than the concentrations of sgp130Fc used in mouse studies and clinical trials. sgp130 inhibited IL6 and OSM signalling in the presence of an ADAM10/17 inhibitor and the absence of soluble IL6R or OSMR, with effects that were indistinguishable from those of a gp130 neutralising antibody. These data show that sgp130Fc does not exclusively block IL6 trans-signalling and reveal instead that broad inhibition of gp130 signalling likely underlies its therapeutic effects. This proposes global or modular inhibition of gp130 as a therapeutic approach for treating human disease.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855816', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031363', 'CorpusId': 267234984, 'PubMed': '38338642'}",1,"Given that sgp130Fc, initially believed to be a selective inhibitor of IL6 trans-signaling, has been shown to broadly inhibit gp130 signaling across various cytokines, my research will explore the therapeutic potential of targeting gp130 signaling pathways.

Increased circulating levels of cytokines have been previously reported and generally associated with worse clinical outcomes. In this context, the modulation of inflammation-related parameters seems to be a reasonable therapeutic option for improving the clinical course of the disease. Based on this, we aimed to compare changes in circulating cytokines when Mediterranean diet alone or in combination with hypercaloric, hyperproteic oral nutritional supplements (ONS), enriched with omega−3 (n−3) polyunsaturated fatty acids were administered to patients with HF. Briefly, patients were randomly assigned to receive Mediterranean Diet (control group) vs. Mediterranean Diet plus ONS (intervention group). We observed increased circulating levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10. MCP-1 and IL-6 were associated with overweight and obesity (p = 0.01–0.01–0.04, respectively); IL-6 and IL-8 were positively correlated with fat mass and CRP serum levels (p = 0.02–0.04, respectively). Circulating levels of IL-8 significantly decreased in all patients treated with the Mediterranean diet, while IL-6 and IP-10 only significantly decreased in patients that received plus ONS. In the univariate analysis, MCP-1 and its combination with IL-6 were associated with increased mortality (p = 0.02), while the multivariate analysis confirmed that MCP-1 was an independent factor for mortality (OR 1.01, 95%ci 1.01–1.02). In conclusion, nutritional support using hypercaloric, hyperproteic, n-3 enriched ONS in combination with Mediterranean Diet was associated with decreased circulating levels of some cytokines and could represent an interesting step for improving heart functionality of patients with HF.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11174422', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16111637', 'CorpusId': 270083505, 'PubMed': '38892570'}",1,"Given that increased inflammation is linked to heart failure (HF) pathogenesis and worse clinical outcomes, targeting inflammation through dietary interventions could be a promising therapeutic strategy.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of the complete plastomes from twenty-two species, covering seventeen genera from three subfamilies (Fumarioideae, Hypecooideae, and Papaveroideae) of Papaveraceae. Our results revealed a high level of variability in the plastid genome size of Papaveraceae, ranging from 151,864 bp to 219,144 bp in length, which might be triggered by the expansion of the IR region and a large number of repeat sequences. Moreover, we detected numerous large-scale rearrangements, primarily occurring in the plastomes of Fumarioideae and Hypecooideae. Frequent gene loss or pseudogenization were also observed for ndhs, accD, clpP, infA, rpl2, rpl20, rpl32, rps16, and several tRNA genes, particularly in Fumarioideae and Hypecooideae, which might be associated with the structural variation in their plastomes. Furthermore, we found that the plastomes of Fumarioideae exhibited a higher GC content and more repeat sequences than those of Papaveroideae. Our results showed that Papaveroideae generally displayed a relatively conserved plastome, with the exception of Eomecon chionantha, while Fumarioideae and Hypecooideae typically harbored highly reconfigurable plastomes, showing high variability in the genome size, gene content, and gene order.

The cellular and mechanical mechanisms of these processes have been studied; however, the underlying molecular regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were applied to investigate potential regulators of the development of ascidian Ciona savignyi larvae. Our results revealed 351 and 138 differentially accessible region genes through comparisons of ATAC-seq data between stages 21 and 24 and between stages 24 and 25, respectively. A joint analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data revealed a correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene transcription. We further verified the tissue expression patterns of 12 different genes. Among them, Cs-matrix metalloproteinase 24 (MMP24) and Cs-krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) were highly expressed in notochord cells. Functional assay results demonstrated that both genes are necessary for notochord lumen formation and expansion. Finally, we performed motif enrichment analysis of the differentially accessible regions in different tailbud stages and summarized the potential roles of these motif-bearing transcription factors in larval development.

Facial malformations have been shown to impact early infant-caregiver interactions negatively. However, it remains unclear how such facial malformations may impact early visual processing. The current study used a combination of eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate adults’ early visual processing of infant faces with cleft lip/palate as compared to normal infant faces, as well as the impact cleft palate has on perceived cuteness. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in early visual attention to the eye region for infants with cleft palate, while increased visual attention is registered on the mouth region. Increased neural processing of the cleft palate was evident at the N170 and LPP, suggesting differences in configural processing and affective responses to the faces. Infants with cleft palate were also rated significantly less cute than their healthy counterparts (mean difference = .73, p < .001). These results suggest that infants’ faces with cleft lip/palate are processed differently at early visual perception.

Particularly due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds, fruits play an important role in the prevention of diseases of civilization. Therefore, it is important to study the phytochemicals and biological activity of fruits, especially those with a long-standing use in ethnomedicine. In this study, we determined the chemical profile and biological activity of a methanolic extract of the Eleutherococcus divaricatus fruits. Amongst nine polyphenols studied, only chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and eleutheroside E have been detected. The extract showed a weak anti-hyaluronidase activity from bovine testicular in a range of 9.06–37.70% and quite high for human serum hyaluronidase from children diagnosed with acute leukemia in a range of 76–86%. A weak anti-tyrosinase activity was obtained in a range of 2.94–12.46%. Moreover, the extract showed antioxidant properties against DPPH radical, ABTS radical, and O2•−. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by FRAP assay and Fe2+ ion chelation assay. These preliminary studies partially justify the traditional use of the plant in inflammatory- and immune-related diseases, in which hyaluronidase and free radicals can participate. A difference in human serum hyaluronidase inhibition may result from the inter-patient variability.

However, the mechanisms by which they interact with gut microbiota to exert benefits are largely unknown. After 8 weeks of NAFLD modeling, C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into five groups and fed a normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD supplemented with a medium or high dose of Silybum marianum extract contained silymarin or polyherbal extract contained silymarin, salvianolic acids B, and puerarin for 16 weeks, respectively. The untargeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing were used for molecular mechanisms exploration. The intervention of silymarin and polyherbal extract significantly improved liver steatosis and recovered liver function in the mice, accompanied by an increase in probiotics like Akkermansia and Blautia, and suppressed Clostridium, which related to changes in the bile acids profile in feces and serum. Fecal microbiome transplantation confirmed that this alteration of microbiota and its metabolites were responsible for the improvement in NAFLD.

In this study, we examined the adult expression profiles of specific miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a neurodevelopmental mouse model for ASD and SCZ that mimics perinatal pathology, such as NMDA receptor hypofunction, and exhibits behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes related to these disorders during adulthood. To model the early neuropathogenesis of the disorders, mouse pups were administered subcutaneously with ketamine (30 mg/Kg) at postnatal days 7, 9, and 11. We focused on a set of miRNAs most frequently altered in ASD (miR-451a and miR-486-3p) and in SCZ (miR-132-3p and miR-137-3p) according to human studies. Additionally, we explored miRNAs whose alterations have been identified in both disorders (miR-21-5p, miR-92a-2-5p, miR-144-3p, and miR-146a-5p). We placed particular emphasis on studying the sexual dimorphism in the dynamics of these miRNAs. Our findings revealed significant alterations in the PFC of this ASD- and SCZ-like mouse model.

Retinal pathology is due to leakage of serum components into retinal tissues, activation of resident phagocytes (microglia), and vascular and neuronal damage. While short-term interventions are available, they do not revert visual function or halt disease progression. The impact of microglial inflammatory responses on the neurovascular unit remains unknown. In this study, we characterized microglia–vascular interactions in an experimental model of DR. Early diabetes presents activated retinal microglia, vascular permeability, and vascular abnormalities coupled with vascular tortuosity and diminished astrocyte and endothelial cell-associated tight-junction (TJ) and gap-junction (GJ) proteins. Microglia exclusively bind to the neuronal-derived chemokine fractalkine (FKN) via the CX3CR1 receptor to ameliorate microglial activation. Using neuron-specific recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs), we therapeutically overexpressed soluble (sFKN) or membrane-bound (mFKN) FKN using intra-vitreal delivery at the onset of diabetes. This study highlights the neuroprotective role of rAAV-sFKN, reducing microglial activation, vascular tortuosity, fibrin(ogen) deposition, and astrogliosis and supporting the maintenance of the GJ connexin-43 (Cx43) and TJ zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) molecules. The results also show that microglia–vascular interactions influence the vascular width upon administration of rAAV-sFKN and rAAV-mFKN. Administration of rAAV-sFKN improved visual function without affecting peripheral immune responses.

To identify brain genomic elements associated with mammalian vocal learning, we integrated genomic, anatomical, and neurophysiological data from the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with analyses of the genomes of 215 placental mammals. First, we identified a set of proteins evolving more slowly in vocal learners. Then, we discovered a vocal motor cortical region in the Egyptian fruit bat, an emergent vocal learner, and leveraged that knowledge to identify active cis-regulatory elements in the motor cortex of vocal learners. Machine learning methods applied to motor cortex open chromatin revealed 50 enhancers robustly associated with vocal learning whose activity tended to be lower in vocal learners. Our research implicates convergent losses of motor cortex regulatory elements in mammalian vocal learning evolution. Editor’s summary The ability to perform complex behaviors, including human speech, is encoded in the billions of nucleotides that make up the genome, the result of millions of years of evolutionary optimization. Although speech itself is uniquely human, vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal output as a result of experience, has evolved independently in multiple mammals, including many bats. Wirthlin et al. combined experiments in the bat brain with an artificial intelligence–based analysis of more than 200 genomes and found hundreds of genomic regions that are associated with vocal learning. Their results implicate networks of genes related to human autism. —Di Jiang A vocal brain region is identified in bats and leveraged in comparative genomic analyses to reveal the evolution of mammalian vocal behavior. INTRODUCTION Vocal production learning (“vocal learning”), or the ability to modify vocalizations according to the social environment, forms the basis of human speech production. Among the Boreoeutherian mammals, this trait has evolved independently in four different lineages: humans, bats, cetaceans, and pinnipeds. In vertebrates, the evolution of vocal learning behavior has been associated with the evolution of brain anatomical features, including cortical long-range projection neurons (e.g., songbirds and humans). Moreover, neural circuits for the production of learned vocalization display convergent evolution in patterns of gene expression. RATIONALE Despite evidence for the convergent evolution of vocal learning at the behavioral, anatomical, and gene expression levels in vertebrates, the genetic underpinnings of vocal learning and human speech in mammals are poorly understood. New machine learning approaches and the newly sequenced mammalian genomes of the Zoonomia Consortium provide the foundation to rigorously study this question. The repeated evolution of vocal learning across mammals allows us to determine which parts of the genome are significantly associated with the behavior. RESULTS First, we studied convergent evolution in protein-coding regions using the RERconverge and HyPhy methods to find 200 significantly associated genes. The genes that tend to be under higher constraint in vocal learning mammals are enriched for genes involved in human autism. However, the vast majority of genes are driven by signals from only one or two clades of vocal learning mammals, suggesting that a large component of the genetic basis for the trait may lie instead in the convergent evolution of regulatory elements. To explore that hypothesis, we performed an anatomical and functional characterization of the Egyptian fruit bat motor cortex. We identified a subregion of the motor cortex that is implicated in vocal production and directly projects to the motoneurons controlling the bat’s larynx. This allowed us to profile candidate regulatory elements active in this vocalization-associated subregion of the motor cortex by measuring open chromatin. These open chromatin regions and 222 mammalian genomes of the Zoonomia Consortium served as input to the Tissue-Aware Conservation Inference Toolkit (TACIT) machine learning approach, which was applied to find 50 candidate regulatory elements whose predicted motor cortex open chromatin measurements across mammals are highly correlated with the presence of vocal learning behavior. Many of these open chromatin regions were near genes associated with autism, and they tended to overlap with open chromatin specific to the long-range projection neurons that have been implicated in the evolution of vocal learning. CONCLUSION Although it is impossible to know which parts of the genome evolved for human speech production, we are able to use the repeated evolution of a component of that behavior, vocal learning, to find significantly associated genes and noncoding regions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of vocal learning behavior in a given clade leads to weak selective pressure across a broad range of genes and stronger selective pressure across a smaller number of motor cortex noncoding regions. These genes and noncoding regions show an association with autism, which suggests that there are shared regulatory networks for vocal and social behavior that tend to adapt in similar ways when a lineage evolves vocal learning behavior. More broadly, our results suggest that the evolutionary history of selective pressures across a location in the genome can provide insight into how that region might influence human behavior. Finding vocal learning–associated regions of the mammalian genome. We compared the evolution of vocal learning behavior to the evolution of coding and noncoding elements of the genome, leveraging anatomical, electrophysiological, and epigenomic experiments in the Egyptian fruit bat orofacial motor cortex (ofM1). We show convergent evidence of the importance of long-range projection neurons and autism-associated gene networks.",2024,Science,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.abn3263', 'CorpusId': 268083161, 'PubMed': '38422184'}",1,"Given that vocal production learning (vocal learning) is a convergently evolved trait among vertebrates, I propose to investigate the genomic and regulatory elements associated with vocal learning across various mammalian species.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, this is exemplified by the temporal patterning miRNAs lin-4 and let-7, but for most miRNAs, developmental expression patterns remain poorly resolved. Indeed, experimentally observed long half-lives may constrain possible dynamics. Here, we profile miRNA expression throughout C. elegans postembryonic development at high temporal resolution, which identifies dynamically expressed miRNAs. We use mathematical models to explore the underlying mechanisms. For let-7, we can explain, and experimentally confirm, a striking stepwise accumulation pattern through a combination of rhythmic transcription and stage-specific regulation of precursor processing by the RNA-binding protein LIN-28. By contrast, the dynamics of several other miRNAs cannot be explained by regulation of production rates alone. Specifically, we show that a combination of oscillatory transcription and rhythmic decay drive rhythmic accumulation of miR-235, orthologous to miR-92 in other animals. We demonstrate that decay of miR-235 and additional miRNAs depends on EBAX-1, previously implicated in target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD). Taken together, our results provide insight into dynamic miRNA decay and establish a resource to studying both the developmental functions of, and the regulatory mechanisms acting on, miRNAs.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11109986', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae115', 'CorpusId': 267781062, 'PubMed': '38381904'}",1,"Given that temporally and spatially controlled miRNA accumulation is crucial for various developmental processes, our research will investigate the dynamic expression and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during postembryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Specifically, we have identified stage-specific regulation mechanisms involving RNA-binding proteins and target-directed miRNA degradation. Our findings suggest that miRNA dynamics are influenced by both rhythmic production and decay processes, providing deeper insights into their developmental functions and regulatory mechanisms."

Because of the presence of a WPE loop instead of a WPD loop in the phosphatase domain, it is often considered to lack phosphatase activity. However, many of PTPN21’s biological functions require its catalytic activity. To reconcile these findings, we have determined the structures of individual PTPN21 FERM, PTP domains, and a complex between FERM-PTP. Combined with biochemical analysis, we have found that PTPN21 PTP is weakly active and is autoinhibited by association with its FERM domain. Disruption of FERM-PTP interaction results in enhanced ERK activation. The oncogenic HPV18 E7 protein binds to PTP at the same location as PTPN21 FERM, indicating that it may act by displacing the FERM domain from PTP. Our results provide mechanistic insight into PTPN21 and benefit functional studies of PTPN21-mediated processes.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10901363', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adi7404', 'CorpusId': 268056711, 'PubMed': '38416831'}",1,"Given that PTPN21, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases, is traditionally considered catalytically inactive due to a WPE loop substitution, its biological roles in cellular processes such as adhesion and motility seem paradoxically dependent on its catalytic activity.

Disruption of this autoinhibition, such as by the oncogenic HPV18 E7 protein, enhances ERK activation. These findings clarify the mechanistic underpinnings of PTPN21 function and suggest that modulating the FERM-PTP interaction could influence PTPN21-mediated cellular processes, providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention."

Prior research has predominantly focused on positive or negative emotions based on prospect theory, such as anxiety, anger, disgust, and depression. However, there has been relatively little research on how sadness affects individuals’ preferences for immediate and future rewards. Methods In this study, 170 college students are recruited as participants, and their emotions are primed with a video before engaging in an intertemporal task. Covariance analysis and logit regression model are established to examine the main and interactive effects of sadness on individuals’ immediate reward preferences. Results The findings reveal that sadness led individuals to prefer smaller immediate rewards, demonstrating a more myopic behavioral pattern, but didn’t affect time discount rate. As the reward baseline increases, sadness’s impact on immediate reward preferences is more pronounced, exacerbating individuals’ myopic behavior.

Because PipX interactions depend on the relative levels of their different partners and of the effector molecules binding to them, in vivo studies are required to understand the physiological significance and contribution of environmental factors to the regulation of PipX complexes. Here, we have used the NanoBiT complementation system to analyse the regulation of complex formation in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 between PipX and each of its two best-characterized partners, PII and NtcA. Our results confirm previous in vitro analyses on the regulation of PipX-PII and PipX-NtcA complexes by 2-oxoglutarate and on the regulation of PipX-PII by the ATP/ADP ratio, showing the disruption of PipX-NtcA complexes due to increased levels of ADP-bound PII in Synechococcus elongatus.

Promoting a robust pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype has emerged as a therapeutic modality that supports tumor clearance, including through synergy with immune checkpoint therapies. Polyglucose nanoparticles (macrins), which possess high macrophage affinity, are useful vehicles for delivering drugs to macrophages, potentially altering their phenotype. Here, we examine the potential of functionalized macrins, synthesized by crosslinking carboxymethyl dextran with L-lysine, as effective carriers of immuno-stimulatory drugs to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Azide groups incorporated during particle synthesis provided a handle for click-coupling of propargyl-modified β-cyclodextrin to macrins under mild conditions. Fluorescence-based competitive binding assays revealed the ability of β-cyclodextrin to non-covalently bind to hydrophobic immuno-stimulatory drug candidates (Keq ~ 103 M-1), enabling drug loading within nanoparticles. Furthermore, transcriptional profiles of macrophages indicated robust pro-inflammatory reprogramming (elevated Nos2 and Il12; suppressed Arg1 and Mrc1 expression levels) for a subset of these immuno-stimulatory agents (UNC2025 and R848). Loading of R848 into the modified macrins improved the drug’s effect on primary murine macrophages by three-fold in vitro. Intravital microscopy in IL-12-eYFP reporter mice (24 h post-injection) revealed a two-fold enhancement in mean YFP fluorescence intensity in macrophages targeted with R848-loaded macrins, relative to vehicle controls, validating the desired pro-inflammatory reprogramming of TAMs in vivo by cell-targeted drug delivery. Finally, in an intradermal MC38 tumor model, cyclodextrin-modified macrin NPs loaded with immunostimulatory drugs significantly reduced tumor growth. Therefore, efficient and effective repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages to an M1-like phenotype—via drug-loaded macrins—inhibits tumor growth and may be useful as an adjuvant to existing immune checkpoint therapies.",2024,Frontiers in Immunology,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10965546', 'DOI': '10.3389/fimmu.2024.1331480', 'CorpusId': 268472416, 'PubMed': '38545103'}",1,"Given that macrophages play a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment by often adopting an immuno-suppressive phenotype that supports tumor growth and immune evasion, our research aims to explore a novel therapeutic strategy to repolarize these cells towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype.

Due to the limited number of FDA-approved targeted therapies for TNBC, there is an ongoing need to understand the molecular underpinnings of TNBC for the development of novel combinatorial treatment strategies. This study evaluated the role of the MerTK receptor tyrosine kinase on proliferation and invasion/metastatic potential in TNBC. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated MerTK expression in 58% of patient-derived TNBC xenografts. The stable overexpression of MerTK in human TNBC cell lines induced an increase in proliferation rates, robust in vivo tumor growth, heightened migration/invasion potential, and enhanced lung metastases. NanoString nCounter analysis of MerTK-overexpressing SUM102 cells (SUM102-MerTK) revealed upregulation of several signaling pathways, which ultimately drive cell cycle progression, reduce apoptosis, and enhance cell survival. Proteomic profiling indicated increased endoglin (ENG) production in SUM102-MerTK clones, suggesting that MerTK creates a conducive environment for increased proliferative and metastatic activity via elevated ENG expression. To determine ENG’s role in increasing proliferation and/or metastatic potential, we knocked out ENG in a SUM102-MerTK clone with CRISPR technology. Although this ENG knockout clone exhibited similar in vivo growth to the parental SUM102-MerTK clone, lung metastasis numbers were significantly decreased ~4-fold, indicating that MerTK enhances invasion and metastasis through ENG. Our data suggest that MerTK regulates a unique proliferative signature in TNBC, promoting robust tumor growth and increased metastatic potential through ENG upregulation.

Aquaporins have also been linked to improved drought tolerance in plants and the regulation of water transport. However, the mechanisms that underlie this association remain to be further explored. In this study, we found that arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi symbiosis could induce the gene expression of the aquaporin ZmTIP2;3 in maize roots. Moreover, compared with the wild-type plants, the maize zmtip2;3 mutant also showed a lower total biomass, colonization rate, relative water content, and POD and SOD activities after arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi symbiosis under drought stress. qRT-PCR assays revealed reduced expression levels of stress genes including LEA3, P5CS4, and NECD1 in the maize zmtip2;3 mutant.

Here, we show that CDCA7 is critical for maintaining global DNA methylation levels across multiple tissues in vivo. A pathogenic Cdca7 missense variant leads to the formation of large, aberrantly hypomethylated domains overlapping with the B genomic compartment but without affecting the deposition of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). CDCA7-associated aberrant DNA hypomethylation translated to localized, tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation that affected large gene clusters. In the brain, we identify CDCA7 as a transcriptional repressor and epigenetic regulator of clustered protocadherin isoform choice. Increased protocadherin isoform expression frequency is accompanied by DNA methylation loss, gain of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and increased binding of the transcriptional regulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Overall, our in vivo work identifies a key role for CDCA7 in safeguarding tissue-specific expression of gene clusters via the DNA methylation pathway.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10857554', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adk3384', 'CorpusId': 267578039, 'PubMed': '38335290'}",1,"Given that the disruption of CDCA7 is linked to aberrant DNA hypomethylation, our research proposes to investigate the role of CDCA7 in maintaining global DNA methylation levels and its impact on transcriptional regulation across various tissues.

This hypomethylation results in tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation affecting large gene clusters. Notably, in the brain, CDCA7 functions as a transcriptional repressor and epigenetic regulator, influencing protocadherin isoform choice through DNA methylation loss, gain of H3K4me3, and increased CTCF binding.

However, tomato-derived nanovesicles (TDNVs) have not been studied for their effects on wound closure yet. TDNVs were isolated from Solanum lycopersicum (var. Piccadilly) ripe tomatoes by ultracentrifugation. Extract (collected during the isolation procedure) and NVs (pellet) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and laser Doppler electrophoresis. Wound healing in the presence of Extract or NVs was analyzed by a scratch assay with monocultures of human keratinocytes (HUKE) or NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Cell proliferation and migration were studied by MTT and agarose spot assay, respectively. The vesicles in the Extract and NV samples were nanosized with a similar mean diameter of 115 nm and 130 nm, respectively. Both Extract and NVs had already accelerated wound closure of injured HUKE and NIH-3T3 monocultures by 6 h post-injury. Although neither sample exerted a cytotoxic effect on HUKE and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, they did not augment cell proliferation. NVs and the Extract increased cell migration of both cell types. NVs from tomatoes may accelerate wound healing by increasing keratinocyte and fibroblast migration.

We have investigated the distribution of histone H1 variants in a breast cancer cell line using ChIP-Seq. Two major groups of variants are identified: H1.2, H1.3, H1.5 and H1.0 are abundant in low GC regions (B compartment), while H1.4 and H1X preferentially localize in high GC regions (A compartment). Examining their abundance within transposable elements (TEs) reveals that H1X and H1.4 are enriched in recently-incorporated TEs (SVA and SINE-Alu), while H1.0/H1.2/H1.3/H1.5 are more abundant in older elements. Notably, H1X is particularly enriched in SVA families, while H1.4 shows the highest abundance in young AluY elements. Although low GC variants are generally enriched in LINE, LTR and DNA repeats, H1X and H1.4 are also abundant in a subset of recent LINE-L1 and LTR repeats. H1X enrichment at SVA and Alu is consistent across multiple cell lines. Further, H1X depletion leads to TE derepression, suggesting its role in maintaining TE repression.

Ten male participants completed five cycling time trials in a fasted state with a seven-day washout period between each trial. Participants completed a fixed amount of work (738.45 ± 150.74 kJ) as fast as possible on a cycle ergometer while rinsing with an oral rinse for 10 s every 12.5% of the trial. An oral rinse (maltodextrin, oligofructose, glucose, sucralose or water control) was given per visit in a randomised, crossover, blinded design. Afterwards, participants had their taste assessed with three stimuli, complex carbohydrate (maltodextrin), sweet (glucose) and sour (citric acid), using taste assessment protocol to determine individual taste sensitivity status. Participants were subsequently grouped according to their complex carbohydrate taste sensitivity and complex carbohydrate taste intensity. There were no significant effects of the oral rinses on cycling performance time (p = 0.173). Participants who did not have improvements in exercise performance with the maltodextrin rinse experienced a stronger taste intensity with complex carbohydrate stimuli at baseline (p = 0.047) and overall (p = 0.047) than those who did have improvements in performance.

Peroxisomes and mitochondria play essential roles in the cellular antiviral immune response, but the effect of BoDV1 infection on peroxisomal and mitochondrial dynamics and their respective antioxidant capacities is still not clear. Using different mouse lines—i.e., tumor necrosis factor-α transgenic (TNFTg; to pro-inflammatory status), TNF receptor-1 knockout (TNFR1ko), and TNFR2ko mice in comparison to wild-type (Wt) mice—we analyzed the abundances of both organelles and their main antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), in neurons of the hippocampal, cerebral, and cerebellar cortices. In TNFTg mice, a strong increase in mitochondrial (6.9-fold) and SOD2 (12.1-fold) abundances was detected; meanwhile, peroxisomal abundance increased slightly (1.5-fold), but that of catalase decreased (2.9-fold). After BoDV1 infection, a strong decrease in mitochondrial (2.1–6.5-fold), SOD2 (2.7–9.1-fold), and catalase (2.7–10.3-fold) abundances, but a slight increase in peroxisomes (1.3–1.6-fold), were detected in Wt and TNFR2ko mice, whereas no changes occurred in TNFR1ko mice.

However, exercise-mediated metabolic transducers for vascular protection remain under-investigated. Untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that wild-type mice undergoing voluntary wheel running exercise expressed increased endothelial stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) that catalyzes anti-inflammatory lipid metabolites, namely, oleic (OA) and palmitoleic acids (PA), to mitigate NF-κB–mediated inflammatory responses. In silico analysis revealed that exercise augmented time-averaged wall shear stress but mitigated flow recirculation and oscillatory shear index in the lesser curvature of the mouse aortic arch. Following exercise, endothelial Scd1–deleted mice (Ldlr−/− Scd1EC−/−) on high-fat diet developed persistent VCAM1-positive endothelium in the lesser curvature and the descending aorta, whereas SCD1 overexpression via adenovirus transfection mitigated endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory biomarkers. Single-cell transcriptomics of the aorta identified Scd1-positive and Vcam1-negative endothelial subclusters interacting with other candidate genes.

We aimed to evaluate the interplay between alcohol consumption, HDL parameters and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In the PREVEND study of 5151 participants (mean age, 53 years; 47.5% males), self-reported alcohol consumption and HDL-P and subspecies (small, medium, and large) by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were assessed. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for first CVD events were estimated. In multivariable linear regression analyses, increasing alcohol consumption increased HDL-C, HDL-P, large and medium HDL, HDL size, and HDL subspecies (H3P, H4P, H6 and H7) in a dose-dependent manner. During a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 323 first CVD events were recorded. Compared with abstainers, the multivariable adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of CVD for occasional to light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumers were 0.72 (0.55–0.94), 0.74 (0.54–1.02), and 0.65 (0.38–1.09), respectively. These associations remained consistent on additional adjustment for each HDL parameter. For CVD, only HDL-C was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of CVD in a fully adjusted analysis (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.97 per 1 SD increment). For coronary heart disease, HDL-C, HDL-P, medium HDL, HDL size, and H4P showed inverse associations, whereas HDL-C and HDL size modestly increased stroke risk. Except for H6P, alcohol consumption did not modify the associations between HDL parameters and CVD risk. The addition of HDL-C, HDL size, or H4P to a CVD risk prediction model containing established risk factors improved risk discrimination. Increasing alcohol consumption is associated with increased HDL-C, HDL-P, large and medium HDL, HDL size, and some HDL subspecies. Associations of alcohol consumption with CVD are largely independent of HDL parameters. The associations of HDL parameters with incident CVD are generally not attenuated or modified by alcohol consumption.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10889823', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25042290', 'CorpusId': 267690520, 'PubMed': '38396968'}",1,"Given that increasing alcohol consumption is associated with increased levels of HDL-C, HDL-P, large and medium HDL, HDL size, and specific HDL subspecies, my research aims to explore the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes and their potential protective effects against cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Additionally, certain HDL parameters like HDL-C, HDL size, and H4P have demonstrated improved CVD risk prediction capabilities when incorporated into existing risk models. This suggests that the protective role of HDL in CVD may be more complex than previously understood, and that alcohol-induced changes in HDL composition could provide novel insights into CVD prevention strategies."

Evidence supports that DKD is mediated by the innate immune system and more specifically by the complement system. Using Ins2Akita T1D diabetic mice, we studied the connection between the complement cascade, inflammation, and fibrosis in early DKD. Data were extracted from a previously published quantitative-mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of kidney glomeruli of 2 (early DKD) and 4 months (moderately advanced DKD)-old Ins2Akita mice and their controls A Spearman rho correlation analysis of complement- versus inflammation- and fibrosis-related protein expression was performed. A cross-omics validation of the correlation analyses’ results was performed using public-domain transcriptomics datasets (Nephroseq). Tissue sections from 43 patients with DKD were analyzed using immunofluorescence. Among the differentially expressed proteins, the complement cascade proteins C3, C4B, and IGHM were significantly increased in both early and later stages of DKD. Inflammation-related proteins were mainly upregulated in early DKD, and fibrotic proteins were induced in moderately advanced stages of DKD. The abundance of complement proteins with fibrosis- and inflammation-related proteins was mostly positively correlated in early stages of DKD. This was confirmed in seven additional human and mouse transcriptomics DKD datasets. Moreover, C3 and IGHM mRNA levels were found to be negatively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (range for C3 rs = −0.58 to −0.842 and range for IGHM rs = −0.6 to −0.74) in these datasets. Immunohistology of human kidney biopsies revealed that C3, C1q, and IGM proteins were induced in patients with DKD and were correlated with fibrosis and inflammation. Our study shows for the first time the potential activation of the complement cascade associated with inflammation-mediated kidney fibrosis in the Ins2Akita T1D mouse model.

Low concentrations of Se can promote plant growth and development. Enhancing grain yield and crop Se content is significant, as major food crops generally have low Se content. Studies have shown that Se biofortification can significantly increase Se content in plant tissues. In this study, the genetic transformation of wheat was conducted to evaluate the agronomic traits of non-transgenic control and transgenic wheat before and after Se application. Se content, speciation, and transfer coefficients in wheat grains were detected. Molecular docking simulations and transcriptome data were utilized to explore the effects of selenium-binding protein-A TaSBP-A on wheat growth and grain Se accumulation and transport. The results showed that TaSBP-A gene overexpression significantly increased plant height (by 18.50%), number of spikelets (by 11.74%), and number of grains in a spike (by 35.66%) in wheat. Under normal growth conditions, Se content in transgenic wheat grains did not change significantly, but after applying sodium selenite, Se content in transgenic wheat grains significantly increased. Analysis of Se speciation revealed that organic forms of selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenocysteine (SeCys) predominated in both W48 and transgenic wheat grains. Moreover, TaSBP-A significantly increased the transfer coefficients of Se from solution to roots and from flag leaves to grains.

Milk-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) within its miRNAs are capable of modulating the recipient cell function. However, the differences between colostrum and mature milk EVs and their biological function in attenuating intestinal epithelial cell injury remain poorly understood. Thus, we carried out the present study to characterize the difference between colostrum and mature milk-derived miRNA of EVs and the effect of colostrum and mature milk EVs on the proliferation, apoptosis, proinflammatory cytokines and intestinal epithelial barrier related genes in IEC-6 induced by LPS. Differential expression of 329 miRNAs was identified between colostrum and mature milk EVs, with 185 miRNAs being downregulated and 144 upregulated. In addition, colostrum contains a greater number and protein concentration of EVs than mature milk. Furthermore, compared to control, EVs derived from colostrum significantly inhibited the expression of apoptosis- (Bax, p53, and caspase-3) and proinflammatory-related genes (TNFα, IL6, and IL1β). EVs derived from mature milk did not affect expression of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, p53, bcl2, and caspase-3). The EVs derived from mature milk significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory-related genes (TNFα and IL6). Western blot analysis also indicated that colostrum and mature milk EVs significantly decreased the apoptosis of IEC-6 cells. The EdU assay results showed that colostrum and mature milk EVs significantly increased the proliferation of IEC-6 cells. The expression of intestinal barrier-related genes (TJP1, CLDN1, OCLN, CDX2, MUC2, and IGF1R) was significantly promoted in IEC-6 cells after colostrum and mature milk EVs addition. Importantly, colostrum and mature milk EVs significantly relieved the LPS-induced inhibition of proliferation and intestinal barrier-related genes expression and attenuated apoptosis and proinflammatory responses induced by LPS in IEC-6 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis also indicated that colostrum and mature milk EVs significantly affect the apoptosis of IEC-6 cells induced by LPS. The results also indicated that EVs derived from colostrum had better effects on inhibiting the apoptosis- and proinflammatory cytokines-related genes expression. However, the EVs derived from mature milk exhibited beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier protection.

Transfer RNA (tRNA) acetylation is found at position 34 (ac4C34) in bacterial tRNAMet and position 12 (ac4C12) in eukaryotic tRNASer and tRNALeu. The biochemical mechanism, structural basis and functional significance of ac4C34 are well understood; however, despite being discovered in the 1960s and identification of Kre33/NAT10 and Tan1/THUMPD1 as modifying apparatuses, ac4C12 modification activity has never been reconstituted for nearly six decades. Here, we successfully reconstituted the ac4C12 modification activity of yeast Kre33 and Tan1. Biogenesis of ac4C12 is primarily dependent on a minimal set of elements, including a canonical acceptor stem, the presence of the 11CCG13 motif and correct D-arm orientation, indicating a molecular ruler mechanism. A single A13G mutation conferred ac4C12 modification to multiple non-substrate tRNAs. Moreover, we were able to introduce ac4C modifications into small RNAs. ac4C12 modification contributed little to tRNA melting temperature and aminoacylation in vitro and in vivo.

Our study aimed to compare the expressions of aromatase B (AroB), glutamine synthetase (GS), and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) in the cerebellum of intact juvenile chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta. To identify the dynamics that determine the involvement of AroB, GS, and CBS in the cellular mechanisms of regeneration, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the expressions of these molecular markers during a long-term primary traumatic brain injury (TBI) and after a repeated acute TBI to the cerebellum of O. keta juveniles. As a result, in intact juveniles, weak or moderate expressions of AroB, GS, and CBS were detected in four cell types, including cells of the neuroepithelial type, migrating, and differentiated cells (graphic abstract, A). At 90 days post injury, local hypercellular areas were found in the molecular layer containing moderately labeled AroB+, GS+, and CBS+ cells of the neuroepithelial type and larger AroB+, GS+, and CBS+ cells (possibly analogous to the reactive glia of mammals); patterns of cells migration and neovascularization were also observed. A repeated TBI caused the number of AroB+, GS+, and CBS+ cells to further increase; an increased intensity of immunolabeling was recorded from all cell types (graphic abstract, C).

While there are numerous measurement tools to evaluate these abilities, many of them have been designed for specific age groups hampering comparability throughout development. Thus, we determined test–retest-reliability and minimal detectable change for a set of tests that evaluate spatial ability performance in their variety in youth and compared them to young adults. Methods Children (age: 11.4 ± 0.5 years, n = 26), adolescents (age: 12.5 ± 0.7 years, n = 22), and young adults (age: 26.1 ± 4.0 years, n = 26) performed a set of five spatial ability tests twice, 20 min apart: Paper Folding Test (PFT), Mental Rotation Test (MRT), Water Level Task (WLT), Corsi Block Test (CBT), and Numbered Cones Run (NCR). Relative and absolute test–retest reliability was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) and the standard error of measurement (SEM), respectively. Further, the minimal detectable change (MDC95%) was calculated to identify clinically relevant changes between repeated measurements. Results Irrespective of test, reliability was “excellent” (i.e., ICC3,1 ≥ 0.75) in all age cohorts and the SEM values were rather small. The MDC95% values needed to identify relevant changes in repeated measurements of spatial ability performance ranged between 0.8 and 13.9% in children, 1.1 and 24.5% in adolescents, and 0.7 and 20.8% in young adults.

These cells play a significant role in leukemia relapse, persisting even after apparent remission. LSCs were first described in 1994 by Lapidot et al. Although they have been extensively studied in acute leukemia, more LSC research is still needed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to understand if reduced apoptosis in mature cells should still be considered as the major cause of this disease. Here, we provide new evidence suggesting the existence of stem-like cell populations in CLL, which may help to understand the disease as well as to develop effective treatments. In this study, we identified a potential leukemic stem cell subpopulation using the tetraploid CLL cell line I83. This subpopulation is characterized by diploid cells that were capable of generating the I83 tetraploid population. Furthermore, we adapted a novel flow cytometry analysis protocol to detect CLL subpopulations with stem cell properties in peripheral blood samples and primary cultures from CLL patients. These cells were identified by their co-expression of CD19 and CD5, characteristic markers of CLL cells. As previously described, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity is indicative of stemness and pluripotency. Moreover, we used this method to investigate the potential synergistic effect of curcumin in combination with fludarabine and ibrutinib to deplete this subpopulation. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of this ALP-based analysis protocol in detecting and monitoring leukemic stem-like cells in CLL. This analysis also identified limitations in eradicating these populations using in vitro testing. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that curcumin significantly enhanced the effects of fludarabine and ibrutinib on the leukemic fraction, exhibiting synergistic effects (combination drug index, CDI 0.97 and 0.37, respectively).

However, the underlying mechanisms of CtIP regulation and how the control of its regulation affects DNA repair remain incompletely characterized. In this study, NUDT16 loss decreases CtIP protein levels and impairs CtIP recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytically inactive NUDT16 mutant is unable to rescue decreased CtIP protein and impaired CtIP recruitment to DSBs. In addition, we identified a novel posttranslational modification of CtIP by ADP-ribosylation that is targeted by a PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, leading to CtIP ubiquitination and degradation. These data suggest that the hydrolase activity of NUDT16 plays a major role in controlling CtIP protein levels. Notably, ADP-ribosylation of CtIP is required for its interaction with NUDT16, its localization at DSBs, and for HR repair. Interestingly, NUDT16 can also be ADP-ribosylated. The ADP-ribosylated NUDT16 is critical for CtIP protein stability, CtIP recruitment to DSBs, and HR repair in response to DNA damage. In summary, we demonstrate that NUDT16 and its PARylation regulate CtIP stability and CtIP recruitment to DSBs, providing new insights into our understanding of the regulation of CtIP-mediated DNA end resection in the HR repair pathway.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11039996', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae064', 'CorpusId': 267546415, 'PubMed': '38324469'}",1,"Given that CtIP is essential for initiating DNA end resection and mediating homologous recombination (HR) repair, understanding its regulation is crucial for effective DNA repair mechanisms.

While traditional small-molecule and antisense-based approaches are effective, we report a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based approach that targets the MALAT1 and MENβ triple helices, structures comprised of a U-rich internal stem-loop and an A-rich tract. Two LNA oligonucleotides resembling the A-rich tract (i.e., A9GCA4) were examined: an LNA (L15) and a phosphorothioate LNA (PS-L15). L15 binds tighter than PS-L15 to the MALAT1 and MENβ stem loops, although both L15 and PS-L15 enable RNA•LNA-RNA triple-helix formation. Based on UV thermal denaturation assays, both LNAs selectively stabilize the Hoogsteen interface by 5–13 °C more than the Watson–Crick interface. Furthermore, we show that L15 and PS-L15 displace the A-rich tract from the MALAT1 and MENβ stem loop and methyltransferase-like protein 16 (METTL16) from the METTL16-MALAT1 triple-helix complex.

However, the quality of summer BT is poor. It was improved by microbial fermentation in a previous study, but whether it affects hypolipidemic activity is unknown. Therefore, we compared the hypolipidemic activity of BT and microbially fermented black tea (EFT). The results demonstrated that BT inhibited weight gain and improved lipid and total bile acid (TBA) levels, and microbial fermentation reinforced this activity. Mechanistically, both BT and EFT mediate bile acid circulation to relieve hyperlipidemia. In addition, BT and EFT improve dyslipidemia by modifying the gut microbiota. Specifically, the increase in Lactobacillus johnsonii by BT, and the increase in Mucispirillum and Colidextribacter by EFT may also be potential causes for alleviation of hyperlipidemia.

TDP-43 localizes predominantly in the nucleus, arranging itself into dynamic condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). Mutations and post-translational modifications can alter the condensation properties of TDP-43, contributing to the transition of liquid-like biomolecular condensates into solid-like aggregates. However, to date it has been a challenge to study the dynamics of this process in vivo. We demonstrate through live imaging that human TDP-43 undergoes nuclear condensation in spinal motor neurons in a living animal. RNA-binding deficiencies as well as post-translational modifications can lead to aberrant condensation and altered TDP-43 compartmentalization. Single-molecule tracking revealed an altered mobility profile for RNA-binding deficient TDP-43.

Serum samples were obtained from 159 women, of whom 77 were diagnosed with endometriosis by laparoscopy and 82 were healthy women. First, a preliminary study identified 29 differentially expressed microRNAs between the two study groups. Next, nine of the differentially expressed microRNAs in the preliminary analysis were evaluated in a new cohort of 67 women with endometriosis and 72 healthy women. Upon validation by quantitative real-time PCR technique, the circulating level of miR-30c-5p was significantly higher in the endometriosis group compared with the healthy women group.

However, the effects of IEG on adipogenesis have not yet been elucidated. Here, we showed that IEG blocks adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells at an early stage. IEG inhibits lipid accumulation in adipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner and reduces the expression of mature adipocyte-related factors including PPARγ, C/EBPα, and FABP4. IEG treatment at different stages of adipogenesis showed that IEG inhibited adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the early stage, as confirmed by lipid accumulation and adipocyte-related biomarkers. The early stage stimulates growth-arrested preadipocytes to enter mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and initiates their differentiation into adipocytes by regulating cell cycle-related factors. IEG arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and attenuated cell cycle-related factors including cyclinD1, CDK6, CDK2, and cyclinB1 during the MCE stage. Furthermore, IEG suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during MCE and inhibits ROS-related antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) and catalase.

To improve maize yield and develop new varieties, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying tassel weight is essential. In this study, tropical maize inbred lines, namely CML312, CML373, CML444, and YML46, were selected as female parents and crossed with the elite maize inbred line Ye107, which served as the common male parent, to develop a multi-parent population comprising four F8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) subpopulations. Using 6616 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we conducted genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) on 642 F8 RILs in four subpopulations across three different environments. Through GWAS, we identified 16 SNPs that were significantly associated with TW, encompassing two stable loci expressed across multiple environments. Furthermore, within the candidate regions of these SNPs, we discovered four novel candidate genes related to TW, namely Zm00001d044362, Zm00001d011048, Zm00001d011049, and Zm00001d031173 distributed on chromosomes 1, 3, and 8, which have not been previously reported. These genes are involved in processes such as signal transduction, growth and development, protein splicing, and pollen development, all of which play crucial roles in inflorescence meristem development, directly affecting TW. The co-localized SNP, S8_137379725, on chromosome 8 was situated within a 16.569 kb long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT), located 22.819 kb upstream and 26.428 kb downstream of the candidate genes (Zm00001d011048 and Zm00001d011049).

Compared to pre-menopausal (PRE-M) women, this study sought to determine dietary protein intake and whether lower levels of circulating E2 in post-menopausal women (POST-M) were occurring alongside increased levels of biomarkers of axonal and neuromuscular junction degeneration (NMJ), inflammation, muscle protein degradation, and reduced indices of muscle quality and performance. Employing a cross-sectional design, PRE-M (n = 6) and POST-M (n = 6) dietary analysis data were collected and participants then donated a blood and urine sample followed by assessments for body composition, motor unit activation, and muscle performance. Independent group t-tests were performed to determine differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). In POST-M women, E2, motor unit activity, muscle quality, and muscle performance were significantly less than those for PRE-M women; however, the levels of c-terminal fragment of agrin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and urinary titin were significantly greater (p < 0.05). POST-M women were also shown to be ingesting fewer total calories and less protein than PRE-M (p < 0.05).

The TFIIH subunit Tfb1 contains a Pleckstrin homology domain (PHD), which was shown to interact with one PHD-binding segment (PB) of Rad4 and two PHD-binding segments (PB1 and PB2) of Rad2 in vitro. Whether and how the different Rad2 and Rad4 PBs interact with the same Tfb1 PHD, and whether and how they affect TCR and GGR within the cell remain mysterious. We found that Rad4 PB constitutively interacts with Tfb1 PHD, and the two proteins may function within one module for damage recognition in TCR and GGR. Rad2 PB1 protects Tfb1 from degradation and interacts with Tfb1 PHD at a basal level, presumably within transcription preinitiation complexes when NER is inactive. During a late step of NER, the interaction between Rad2 PB1 and Tfb1 PHD augments, enabling efficient TCR and GGR. Rather than interacting with Tfb1 PHD, Rad2 PB2 constrains the basal interaction between Rad2 PB1 and Tfb1 PHD, thereby weakening the protection of Tfb1 from degradation and enabling rapid augmentation of their interactions within TCR and GGR complexes.

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) protein is one of the master regulators of angiogenesis. This study unveils a novel aspect of TSP1 regulation through reversible phosphorylation. The silencing of the B55α regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in endothelial cells led to a significant decrease in TSP1 expression. Direct interaction between TSP1 and PP2A-B55α was confirmed via various methods. Truncated TSP1 constructs were employed to identify the phosphorylation site and the responsible kinase, ultimately pinpointing PKC as the enzyme phosphorylating TSP1 on Ser93. The biological effects of B55α–TSP1 interaction were also analyzed. B55α silencing not only counteracted the increase in TSP1 expression during wound closure but also prolonged wound closure time. Although B55α silenced cells initiated tube-like structures earlier than control cells, their spheroid formation was disrupted, leading to disintegration. Cells transfected with phosphomimic TSP1 S93D exhibited smaller spheroids and reduced effectiveness in tube formation, revealing insights into the effects of TSP1 phosphorylation on angiogenic properties.

Its ubiquity as a defensive agent has led to repeated independent evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in animals. TTX binds to voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) consisting of α and β subunits. Virtually all studies investigating the mechanisms behind TTX resistance have focused on the α subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, where tetrodotoxin binds. However, the possibility of β subunits also contributing to tetrodotoxin resistance was never explored, though these subunits act in concert. In this study, we present preliminary evidence suggesting a potential role of β subunits in the evolution of TTX resistance. We gathered mRNA sequences for all β subunit types found in vertebrates across 12 species (three TTX-resistant and nine TTX-sensitive) and tested for signatures of positive selection with a maximum likelihood approach. Our results revealed several sites experiencing positive selection in TTX-resistant taxa, though none were exclusive to those species in subunit β1, which forms a complex with the main physiological target of TTX (VGSC Nav1.4).

Rice (Oryza sativa) R2R3-MYB transcription factors function in the transcriptional regulation of plant responses to various abiotic stresses and micronutrient deprivation, but little is known about their roles in Pi starvation signaling and Pi homeostasis. Here, we identified the R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene OsMYB58, which shares high sequence similarity with AtMYB58. OsMYB58 expression was induced more strongly by Pi starvation than by other micronutrient deficiencies. Overexpressing OsMYB58 in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice inhibited plant growth and development under Pi-deficient conditions. In addition, the overexpression of OsMYB58 in plants exposed to Pi deficiency strongly affected root development, including seminal root, lateral root, and root hair formation. Overexpressing OsMYB58 strongly decreased the expression of the rice microRNAs OsmiR399a and OsmiR399j. By contrast, overexpressing OsMYB58 strongly increased the expression of rice PHOSPHATE 2 (OsPHO2), whose expression is repressed by miR399 during Pi starvation signaling. OsMYB58 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the expression of its target genes, as determined by a transcriptional activity assay.

BRs control important agronomic traits and responses to abiotic stresses. Through the signaling pathway, BRs control the expression of thousands of genes, resulting in a variety of biological responses. The key effectors of the BR pathway are two transcription factors (TFs): BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BRI1-EMSSUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1). Both TFs are phosphorylated and inactivated by the Glycogen synthase kinase 3 BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), which acts as a negative regulator of the BR pathway. In our study, we describe the functional characteristics of HvGSK1.1, which is one of the GSK3/SHAGGY-like orthologs in barley. We generated mutant lines of HvGSK1.1 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the edited region of the HvGSK1.1 showed a wide variety of mutations. Most of the changes (frameshift, premature stop codon, and translation termination) resulted in the knock-out of the target gene. The molecular and phenotypic characteristics of the mutant lines showed that the knock-out mutation of HvGSK1.1 improved plant growth performance under salt stress conditions and increased the thousand kernel weight of the plants grown under normal conditions. The inactivation of HvGSK1.1 enhanced BR-dependent signaling, as indicated by the results of the leaf inclination assay in the edited lines. The plant traits under investigation are consistent with those known to be regulated by BRs.

Hence, we investigated the potential correlation between neutrophil inflammatory markers and the prognosis of ACS patients with/without diabetes and explored whether neutrophils demonstrate a unique inflammatory phenotype in patients experiencing an adverse in-hospital outcome. The study enrolled 229 ACS patients with or without diabetes. Poor evolution was defined as either death, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, Killip Class 3/4, ventricular arrhythmias, or mechanical complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to identify clinical and paraclinical factors associated with in-hospital outcomes. Neutrophils isolated from fresh blood were investigated using qPCR, Western blot, enzymatic assay, and immunofluorescence. Poor evolution post-myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with increased number, activity, and inflammatory status of neutrophils, as indicated by significant increase of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Among the patients with complicated evolution, neutrophil activity had an important prognosis value for diabetics. Neutrophils from patients with unfavorable evolution revealed a pro-inflammatory phenotype with increased expression of CCL3, IL-1β, interleukin-18 (IL-18), S100A9, intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloprotease (MMP-9), of molecules essential in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production p22phox and Nox2, and increased capacity to form neutrophil extracellular traps.

The SMC5/6 complex has consistently been implicated in the maintenance of replication fork integrity. However, the essential role of the SMC5/6 complex during DNA replication in mammalian cells has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigate the molecular consequences of SMC5/6 loss at the replication fork in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), employing the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system to deplete SMC5 acutely and reversibly in the defined cellular contexts of replication fork stall and restart. In SMC5-depleted cells, we identify a defect in the restart of stalled replication forks, underpinned by excess MRE11-mediated fork resection and a perturbed localization of fork protection factors to the stalled fork. Previously, we demonstrated a physical and functional interaction of SMC5/6 with the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a cullin deneddylase that enzymatically regulates cullin ring ligase (CRL) activity. Employing a combination of DNA fiber techniques, the AID system, small-molecule inhibition assays, and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, we show that SMC5/6 promotes the localization of fork protection factors to stalled replication forks by negatively modulating the COP9 signalosome (CSN).

Our previous work showed that 18:1-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which activates the G protein-coupled receptor LPAR1, induces CCN1 between 2–4 h in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in a manner than enhances cell-substrate adhesion. While the time course of induction suggests that CCN1 contributes to intermediate events in LPA action, the roles of CCN1 in LPA-mediated signal transduction have not been fully elucidated. This study utilized a comprehensive global proteomics approach to identify proteins up- or down-regulated in response to treatment of PC-3 cells with LPA for three hours, during the time of peak CCN1 levels. In addition, the effects of siRNA-mediated CCN1 knockdown on LPA responses were analyzed. The results show that, in addition to CCN1, LPA increased the levels of multiple proteins. Proteins up-regulated by LPA included metastasis-associated in colon cancer protein 1 (MACC1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1/THBS1); both MACC1 and TSP1 regulated cancer cell adhesion and motility. LPA down-regulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). CCN1 knockdown suppressed the LPA-induced up-regulation of 30 proteins; these included MACC1 and TSP1, as confirmed by immunoblotting.

Specifically, I aim to elucidate the role of CCN1 in mediating LPA-induced signal transduction and its downstream effects on protein regulation and cancer cell behavior. Preliminary findings indicate that LPA not only increases CCN1 levels but also up-regulates proteins associated with cancer metastasis and cell motility, such as MACC1 and TSP1, while down-regulating TXNIP. The knockdown of CCN1 significantly impacts the expression of these proteins, suggesting that CCN1 is integral to the LPA signaling cascade. This research will explore the potential of targeting the LPA-CCN1 axis as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment."

However, the standard workflow requires over 200 ng of input DNA, hindering its application to small cell-number samples, such as primordial germ cells. We developed experimental and analysis workflows to extend this technology to suboptimal input DNA conditions, including ultra-low input down to single cells. DNA preamplification significantly enhanced detection rates to over 50% in five-cell samples and ∼25% in single cells. Enzymatic conversion also substantially improved data quality. Computationally, we developed a method to model the background signal's influence on the DNA methylation level readings. The modified detection P-value calculation achieved higher sensitivities for low-input datasets and was validated in over 100 000 public diverse methylome profiles. We employed the optimized workflow to query the demethylation dynamics in mouse primordial germ cells available at low cell numbers. Our data revealed nuanced chromatin states, sex disparities, and the role of DNA methylation in transposable element regulation during germ cell development.

Because of relatively high modulus, shape memory polymers (SMPs) have been widely used for 4D printing. However, most SMPs for 4D printing are thermosets, which only have one permanent shape. Despite the efforts that implement covalent adaptable networks (CANs) into SMPs to achieve shape reconfigurability, weak thermomechanical properties of the current CAN-SMPs exclude them from practical applications. Here, we report reconfigurable 4D printing via mechanically robust CAN-SMPs (MRC-SMPs), which have high deformability at both programming and reconfiguration temperatures (>1400%), high Tg (75°C), and high room temperature modulus (1.06 GPa). The high printability for DLP high-resolution 3D printing allows MRC-SMPs to create highly complex SMP 3D structures that can be reconfigured multiple times under large deformation. The demonstrations show that the reconfigurable 4D printing allows one printed SMP structure to fulfill multiple tasks.",2024,Science Advances,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11095468', 'DOI': '10.1126/sciadv.adl4387', 'CorpusId': 269787027, 'PubMed': '38748786'}",1,"Given that 4D printing leverages shape memory polymers (SMPs) to create structures that change shape over time in response to environmental stimuli, the primary challenge has been the limited reconfigurability and weak thermomechanical properties of current SMPs, particularly those integrated with covalent adaptable networks (CANs).

Given the range of joint numbers within a given digit—from 1 in the human thumb to over 10 in the second digit of certain species of whale—it has been speculated that self-organizing mechanisms may underlie the initiation of these repetitive segmentation patterns. Here, using single-cell molecular profiling, in vivo growth series, and mathematical modeling, we uncover a self-organizing Turing system that determines digit segmentation.

This study explored the effect of AMK extract on apoptosis and tumor-grafted mice using AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. We investigated the compounds, target genes, and associated diseases of AMK using the Traditional Chinese Medical Systems Pharmacy (TCMSP) database platform. Cell viability assay, cell cycle and mitochondrial depolarization analysis, caspase activity assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, and wound healing and spheroid formation assay were used to investigate the anti-cancer effects of AMK extract on AGS cells. Also, in vivo studies were conducted using subcutaneous xenografts. AMK extract reduced the viability of AGS cells and increased the sub-G1 cell fraction and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Also, AMK extract increased the production of ROS. AMK extract induced the increased caspase activities and modulated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In addition, AMK extract effectively inhibited AGS cell migration and led to a notable reduction in the growth of AGS spheroids. Moreover, AMK extract hindered the growth of AGS xenograft tumors in NSG mice.

It grows onto the corneal surface or limbus, causing blurred vision and cosmetic issues. Ultraviolet is a well-known risk factor for the development of a pterygium, although its pathogenesis remains unclear, with only limited understanding of its hereditary basis. In this study, we collected RNA-seq from both pterygial tissues and conjunctival tissues (as controls) from six patients (a total of twelve biological samples) and retrieved publicly available data, including eight pterygium samples and eight controls. We investigated the intrinsic gene regulatory mechanisms closely linked to the inflammatory reactions of pterygiums and compared Asian (Korea) and the European (Germany) pterygiums using multiple analysis approaches from different perspectives. The increased expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress and DNA damage implies an association between these factors and pterygium development. Also, our comparative analysis revealed both similarities and differences between Asian and European pterygiums. The decrease in gene expressions involved in the three primary inflammatory signaling pathways—JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NF-kappa B signaling—suggests a connection between pathway dysfunction and pterygium development. We also observed relatively higher activity of autophagy and antioxidants in the Asian group, while the European group exhibited more pronounced stress responses against oxidative stress. These differences could potentially be necessitated by energy-associated pathways, specifically oxidative phosphorylation.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11083828', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25094789', 'CorpusId': 269550264, 'PubMed': '38732006'}",1,"Given that pterygium, a common conjunctival degeneration, is influenced by ultraviolet exposure but its detailed pathogenesis and hereditary aspects remain underexplored, this study aims to elucidate the intrinsic gene regulatory mechanisms associated with its inflammatory reactions.

However, their direct DNA-transcription factor (TF) interactions are mostly unidentified. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are a widely used model for studying gene expression regulation. Thus, this model serves as a rich source of various next-generation sequencing data sets, including a large number of TF cistromes. By processing and integrating the available cistromic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data from BMDMs, we characterized the macrophage-specific direct DNA-TF interactions, with a particular emphasis on those specific for promoters. Whilst active promoters are enriched for certain types of typically methylatable elements, more than half of them contain non-methylatable and prototypically promoter-distal elements. In addition, circa 14% of promoters—including that of Csf1r—are composed exclusively of ‘distal’ elements that provide cell type-specific gene regulation by specialized TFs. Similar to CG-rich promoters, these also contain methylatable CG sites that are demethylated in a significant portion and show high polymerase activity. We conclude that this unusual class of promoters regulates cell type-specific gene expression in macrophages, and such a mechanism might exist in other cell types too.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11077085', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkae088', 'CorpusId': 267632912, 'PubMed': '38348998'}",1,"Given that mammalian promoters consist of diverse elements facilitating the selection of transcript variants across different cell types and conditions, my research aims to explore the specific DNA-transcription factor (TF) interactions within these promoters.

Anthocyanins are the principal pigment responsible for color presentation in ornamental plants. We employ a multi-omics approach to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanins in Ph. nigra. Firstly, we found that the pigments of the culm of Ph. nigra accumulated only in one to four layers of cells below the epidermis. The levels of total anthocyanins and total flavonoids gradually increased during the process of bamboo culm color formation. Metabolomics analysis indicated that the predominant pigment metabolites observed were petunidin 3-O-glucoside and malvidin O-hexoside, exhibiting a significant increase of up to 9.36-fold and 13.23-fold, respectively, during pigmentation of Ph. nigra culm. Transcriptomics sequencing has revealed that genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways were significantly enriched, leading to color formation. A total of 62 differentially expressed structural genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis were identified. Notably, PnANS2, PnUFGT2, PnCHI2, and PnCHS1 showed significant correlations with anthocyanin metabolites. Additionally, certain transcription factors such as PnMYB6 and PnMYB1 showed significant positive or negative correlations with anthocyanins. With the accumulation of sucrose, the expression of PnMYB6 is enhanced, which in turn triggers the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Based on these findings, we propose that these key genes primarily regulate the anthocyanin synthesis pathway in the culm and contribute to the accumulation of anthocyanin, ultimately resulting in the purple-black coloration of Ph. nigra.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10855043', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25031738', 'CorpusId': 267492367, 'PubMed': '38339012'}",1,"Given that Phyllostachys nigra exhibits a color transformation from green young culms to purple-black mature culms due to anthocyanin accumulation, our research will investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis in this species.

During bacterial spore formation, a progenitor cell asymmetrically divides and differentiates into two different cell types. We show that differential transcription in the smaller daughter cell is achieved by a biased localization of a transcriptional activator on one face of the asymmetric division septum and that the correct placement of this factor is dependent on the core cell division machinery. Thus, an intrinsic asymmetry provided by a division septum can provide the basis for the differential transcription of genes during development.",2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10990147', 'DOI': '10.1073/pnas.2400584121', 'CorpusId': 268535974, 'PubMed': '38502707'}",1,"Given that cellular differentiation is driven by the differential transcription of genes in daughter cells, our research aims to explore how intrinsic asymmetries during cell division contribute to this process.

Thus, the present study examined how neural responses to portion size relate to changes in weight and energy consumed as portions increase. Associations were examined across brain regions traditionally implicated in appetite control (i.e., an appetitive network) as well as the cerebellum, which has recently been implicated in appetite-related processes. Children without obesity (i.e., BMI-for-age-and-sex percentile < 90; N = 63; 55% female) viewed images of larger and smaller portions of food during fMRI and, in separate sessions, ate four meals that varied in portion size. Individual-level linear and quadratic associations between intake (kcal, grams) and portion size (i.e., portion size slopes) were estimated. The response to portion size in cerebellar lobules IV–VI was associated with the quadratic portion size slope estimated from gram intake; a greater response to images depicting smaller compared to larger portions was associated with steeper increases in intake with increasing portion sizes. Within the appetitive network, neural responses were not associated with portion size slopes. A decreased cerebellar response to larger amounts of food may increase children’s susceptibility to overeating when excessively large portions are served.",2024,Nutrients,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10933954', 'DOI': '10.3390/nu16050738', 'CorpusId': 268305343, 'PubMed': '38474866'}",1,"Given that the neural mechanisms driving the portion size effect are not well understood, this study investigates how brain responses to varying food portion sizes are linked to changes in weight and energy intake.

The findings reveal that the cerebellum, particularly lobules IV–VI, plays a significant role in how children respond to portion sizes, with a diminished cerebellar response to larger food portions correlating with a higher susceptibility to overeating. Conversely, traditional appetite control regions did not show a significant association with portion size slopes. This suggests that interventions targeting cerebellar activity could potentially mitigate overeating in response to large food portions."

Understanding the genetic architecture of drought tolerance in maize is a crucial step towards the breeding of drought-tolerant varieties and a targeted exploitation of genetic resources. In this study, 511 quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to grain yield components, flowering time, and plant morphology under drought conditions, as well as drought tolerance index were collected from 27 published studies and then projected on the IBM2 2008 Neighbors reference map for meta-analysis. In total, 83 meta-QTL (MQTL) associated with drought tolerance in maize were identified, of which 20 were determined as core MQTL. The average confidence interval of MQTL was strongly reduced compared to that of the previously published QTL. Nearly half of the MQTL were confirmed by co-localized marker-trait associations from genome-wide association studies. Based on the alignment of rice proteins related to drought tolerance, 63 orthologous genes were identified near the maize MQTL. Furthermore, 583 candidate genes were identified within the 20 core MQTL regions and maize–rice homologous genes. Based on KEGG analysis of candidate genes, plant hormone signaling pathways were found to be significantly enriched.

To remobilize ribosomes, bacteria use rescue factors such as HflXr, a homolog of the conserved housekeeping GTPase HflX that catalyzes the dissociation of translationally inactive ribosomes into individual subunits. Here we use time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the mechanism of ribosome recycling by Listeria monocytogenes HflXr. Within the 70S ribosome, HflXr displaces helix H69 of the 50S subunit and induces long-range movements of the platform domain of the 30S subunit, disrupting inter-subunit bridges B2b, B2c, B4, B7a and B7b. Our findings unveil a unique ribosome recycling strategy by HflXr which is distinct from that mediated by RRF and EF-G.

Specialized metabolites are synthesized in dedicated cells or tissues, with pathway genes sometimes colocalizing in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, the mechanisms by which spatial expression patterns arise and the role of BGCs in pathway evolution remain underappreciated. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms driving acylsugar evolution in the Solanaceae. Previously thought to be restricted to glandular trichomes, acylsugars were recently found in cultivated tomato roots. We demonstrated that acylsugars in cultivated tomato roots and trichomes have different sugar cores, identified root-enriched paralogs of trichome acylsugar pathway genes, and characterized a key paralog required for root acylsugar biosynthesis, SlASAT1-LIKE (SlASAT1-L), which is nested within a previously reported trichome acylsugar BGC. Last, we provided evidence that ASAT1-L arose through duplication of its paralog, ASAT1, and was trichome-expressed before acquiring root-specific expression in the Solanum genus.

Here, we describe how the single-celled protist Lacrymaria olor, a 40-micrometer cell, is capable of reversibly and repeatably extending its necklike protrusion up to 1200 micrometers in 30 seconds. We discovered a layered cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture that enables hyperextensions through the folding and unfolding of cellular-scale origami. Physical models of this curved crease origami display topological singularities, including traveling developable cones and cytoskeletal twisted domain walls, which provide geometric control of hyperextension. Our work unravels how cell geometry encodes behavior in single cells and provides inspiration for geometric control in microrobotics and deployable architectures. Editor’s summary Morphological changes in cellular shape have been studied in the context of cell division, movement through confined spaces, or functionality such as the beating of a heart or digestion within the gut. Flaum and Prakash explored the mechanisms that allow for the rapid hyperextension seen in the predatory ciliate Lacrymaria olor, which can extend a neck-like feeding apparatus up to 1.2 millimeters in less than 30 seconds (see the Perspective by Gordillo and Cerda). Using a combination of live imaging, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy, the authors identified a curved crease origami structure in the subcellular components that enables the rapid shape changes. —Marc S. Lavine INTRODUCTION Single-celled protists display a remarkable diversity of forms and accomplish a wide range of functions, including hunting live prey in dynamic environments. Lacrymaria olor, a predatory ciliate, hunts its prey by launching a necklike proboscis that can reversibly extend more than 30 times its original body length in <30 s and perform this task repeatably (more than 20,000 times in its life cycle). Such large-scale morphodynamics—an ability to shapeshift in real time—can be quantified by the large strain and strain rate seen in a single cell. Fundamental limits of morphodynamics and how geometry encodes behavior in single cells remain largely unknown. RATIONALE Protists display remarkable strategies to thrive in almost all ecological niches in our planet, from the deep sea to our river streams. Although the relationship between form and function is the bedrock of biological studies, we still have a poor understanding when it comes to explaining the explosive morphological diversity of protists. By applying a lens of geometry, we explored the link between form and function in an iconic, shapeshifting protist, L. olor, which is known to capture prey through the dynamics of an ultralong necklike proboscis. With the advent of various cutting-edge imaging tools, we mapped subcellular components such as the cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture of this cell caught in various morphological states, including a contracted and an extended state. Because geometry is scale free, the essential features of the coupled cytoskeletal-membrane architecture can be captured in a scaled-up physical origami model. In this work, we demonstrate how topological singularities in this geometry can control physical transformation of a cell. The deployment of a necklike protrusion through cellular scale origami is one of the largest strain and extension rates observed in a single cell. RESULTS We compared largest known strain and strain rates in single-cell morphodynamics and identified L. olor as an outlier. With high-resolution imaging, we discovered that this linear extension is supported by a helical architecture of the cortical cytoskeleton composed of microtubule bands layered in multiple layers forming membrane pleats. This particular geometry stores both membrane and microtubule filaments necessary for rapid deployment of a long proboscis, forming a curved crease origami. The sharp transition between the folded and unfolded state in this curved crease cellular origami is controlled by the presence of two topological singularities: a “d-cone” (developable cone) and a “twist singularity” of the microtubule band. We also built a scaled-up model of this origami to reveal how the coupled dynamics of d-cone and twist traversal leads to the nonaffine nature (spooling) of this deployable origami. Our work reveals how topological singularities can be used by a cell to control deployment of subcellular components and unravels the embodied nature of control of behavior through geometry in this ciliate. CONCLUSION As recent studies continue to highlight important ecological roles of protists, it has become critical to understand the origins of complex behavior in these remarkable single cells. Much effort has been put on mapping the genetic diversity of these cells, but we still know very little about the morphological (geometrical) diversity and its function in protists at large. By mapping the subcellular geometry of the cytoskeleton of L. olor, we uncovered geometrical control of extreme morphing behavior in a single cell. As a living example of a microtubule-patterned curved crease origami, our deeper understanding of this structure opens new doors for synthesis of cytoskeleton-based bioengineered materials with transformable characteristics such as deployability. Our work also provides direct inspiration for deployable microrobotics and light-weight space architecture. The blueprints we have been looking for to bring agency and embedded control in microrobotics might be hidden in plain sight in the geometrical diversity of protists. Curved crease origami in a single cell enables rapid, reversible hyperextension. Hyperextension in the single-cell L. olor is enabled by microtubule and membrane storage in contiguous helical pleats that form a curved crease origami. Harnessing this scale-free geometry, the deployment mechanics were deciphered by use of scaled-up physical models. Reversible deployment of the necklike proboscis is controlled by topological singularities that include traveling d-cones in the membrane and twist singularities in the microtubule bands.",2024,Science,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1126/science.adk5511', 'CorpusId': 270285438, 'PubMed': '38843314'}",1,"Given that the single-celled protist Lacrymaria olor demonstrates remarkable hyperextension capabilities by extending its necklike protrusion up to 1200 micrometers in 30 seconds, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that enable such extreme morphological changes.

The presence of Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons was evaluated at 4, 12, 24, 48 h and 1 week later. A small number of degenerated neurons was observed in the CL, as well as in the DEn at P12 and P15. The number of degenerated neurons was increased in the CL as well as in the DEn at P18 and above and was highest at longer survival intervals. The CL at P15 and 18 contained a small or moderate number of degenerated neurons mainly close to the medial and dorsal margins also designated as DCl (“shell”) while isolated degenerated neurons were distributed in the VCl (“core”). In P21 and 25, a larger number of degenerated neurons occurred in both subdivisions of the dorsal claustrum. The majority of degenerated neurons in the endopiriform nucleus were found in the intermediate and caudal third of the DEn. A small number of degenerated neurons was dispersed in the whole extent of the DEn with prevalence to its medial margin. Our results indicate that degenerated neurons in the claustrum CL and endopiriform nucleus are distributed mainly in subdivisions originating from the ventral pallium; their distribution correlates with chemoarchitectonics of both nuclei and with their intrinsic and extrinsic connections.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10816976', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25021296', 'CorpusId': 267186427, 'PubMed': '38279295'}",1,"Given that the distribution and timing of neuronal degeneration in specific brain regions following lithium–pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in rat pups vary with age and survival intervals, my research aims to further investigate the underlying mechanisms driving this selective vulnerability.

Nutrients stimulate GLP-1 release; however, GLP-1 has a short half-life (<2 min), and only <10–15% reaches the systemic circulation. Human L-cells are localized in the distal ileum and colon, while most nutrients are absorbed in the proximal intestine. We hypothesized that combinations of amino acids and fatty acids potentiate GLP-1 release via different L-cell receptors. GLP-1 secretion was studied in the mouse enteroendocrine STC-1 cells. Cells were pre-incubated with buffer for 1 h and treated with nutrients: alpha-linolenic acid (αLA), phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and their combinations αLA+Phe and αLA+Trp with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor. After 1 h GLP-1 in supernatants was measured and cell lysates taken for qPCR. αLA (12.5 µM) significantly stimulated GLP-1 secretion compared with the control. Phe (6.25–25 mM) and Trp (2.5–10 mM) showed a clear dose response for GLP-1 secretion. The combination of αLA (6.25 µM) and either Phe (12.5 mM) or Trp (5 mM) significantly increased GLP-1 secretion compared with αLA, Phe, or Trp individually.

We investigated three antiretrovirals—lamivudine, doravirine, and cabotegravir—in A375, FO-1, and SK-Mel-28, BRAF-mutated, and in MeWo, P53-mutated, melanoma cell lines. The findings indicate a general capability of these drugs to downregulate the expression of HERV-K Pol and Env genes and hinder cell viability, mobility, and colony formation capacity of melanoma cells. The antiretroviral drugs also demonstrate selectivity against malignant cells, sparing normal human epithelial melanocytes. The study reveals that the integrase inhibitor cabotegravir is particularly effective in inhibiting cell growth and invasion across different cell lines in comparison with lamivudine and doravirine, which are inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. The investigation further delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, highlighting the potential induction of ferroptosis, apoptosis, and alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins. Our findings showed cytostatic effects principally revealed in A375, and SK-Mel-28 cell lines through a downregulation of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and/or cyclin D1 expression. Signs of ferroptosis were detected in both A375 cells and FO-1 cells by a decrease in glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferritin expression, as well as by an increase in transferrin protein levels. Apoptosis was also detected in FO-1 and SK-Mel-28, but only with cabotegravir treatment. Moreover, we explored the expression and activity of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein and its correlation with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Both the STING activity and PD-L1 expression were decreased, suggesting that the antiretroviral treatments may counteract the detrimental effects of PD-L1 expression activation through the STING/interferon pathway triggered by HERV-K. Finally, this study underscores the potential therapeutic significance of cabotegravir in melanoma treatment.

We offer a resolution of this debate; we show that two important dynamical regimes, typically considered incompatible, can coexist in the same local cortical circuit by separating them into two different subspaces. In awake mouse motor cortex, we find a low-dimensional subspace with large fluctuations consistent with criticality—a dynamical regime with moderate correlations and multi-scale information capacity and transmission. Orthogonal to this critical subspace, we find a high-dimensional subspace containing a desynchronized dynamical regime, which may optimize input discrimination. The critical subspace is apparent only at long timescales, which explains discrepancies among some previous studies. Using a computational model, we show that the emergence of a low-dimensional critical subspace at large timescales agrees with established theory of critical dynamics.

A spore suspension of E. amstelodami was administered to C57BL/6 mice to alleviate DSS-induced colitis. The findings indicated that administering E. amstelodami evidently enhanced the ultrastructure of colonic epithelium, showing characteristics such as enhanced TJ length, reduced microvilli damage, and enlarged intercellular space. After HLL supplementation, the activation of the liver inflammation pathway, including TLR4/NF-kB and NLRP3 inflammasome caused by DSS, was significantly suppressed, and bile acid metabolism, linking liver and gut, was enhanced, manifested by restoration of bile acid receptor (FXR, TGR5) level. The dysbiosis of the gut microbes in colitis mice was also restored by HLL intervention, characterized by the enrichment of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Faecalibaculum) and fungi (Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Wallemia, Eurotium, and Cladosporium), which was closely associated with lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and was negatively correlated with inflammatory gene expression.

This study utilized two research models: an in vitro model employing the U87 cell line and a second model involving tumors resected from patients (including tumor core, enhancing tumor region, and peritumoral area). ER expression was assessed at both gene and protein levels, with the results validated using confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Under hypoxic conditions, the U87 line displayed a decrease in ERβ mRNA expression and an increase in ERα mRNA expression. In patient samples, ERβ mRNA expression was lower in the tumor core compared to the enhancing tumor region (only in males when the study group was divided by sex). In addition, ERβ protein expression was lower in the tumor core than in the peritumoral area (only in women when the study group was divided by sex).

Under MiDS, SA-sprayed leaves retained significantly higher (+36%) chlorophyll content compared to NS, SA-sprayed leaves. PSII efficiency in SA-sprayed leaves under NS conditions, evaluated at both low light (LL, 200 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and high light (HL, 900 μmol photons m−2 s−1), increased significantly with a parallel significant decrease in the excitation pressure at PSII (1-qL) and the excess excitation energy (EXC). This enhancement of PSII efficiency under NS conditions was induced by the mechanism of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) that reduced singlet oxygen (1O2) production, as indicated by the reduced quantum yield of non-regulated energy loss in PSII (ΦNO). Under MiDS, the thylakoid structure of water-sprayed leaves appeared slightly dilated, and the efficiency of PSII declined, compared to NS conditions. In contrast, the thylakoid structure of SA-sprayed leaves did not change under MiDS, while PSII functionality was retained, similar to NS plants at HL. This was due to the photoprotective heat dissipation by NPQ, which was sufficient to retain the same percentage of open PSII reaction centers (qp), as in NS conditions and HL. We suggest that the redox status of the plastoquinone pool (qp) under MiDS and HL initiated the acclimation response to MiDS in SA-sprayed leaves, which retained the same electron transport rate (ETR) with control plants. Foliar spray of SA could be considered as a method to improve PSII efficiency in basil plants under NS conditions, at both LL and HL, while under MiDS and HL conditions, basil plants could retain PSII efficiency similar to control plants.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11171592', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25115728', 'CorpusId': 270005240, 'PubMed': '38891916'}",1,"Given that salicylic acid (SA) application can enhance photosystem II (PSII) efficiency in basil plants, this research proposes exploring the mechanisms by which SA improves PSII functionality under both non-stress (NS) and mild drought-stress (MiDS) conditions.

Despite the importance of cardiomyocyte maturation, the molecular mechanisms governing this critical process remain largely unexplored. METHODS: We leveraged an in vivo mosaic knockout system to characterize the role of Carm1, the founding member of protein arginine methyltransferase, in cardiomyocyte maturation. Using a battery of assays, including immunohistochemistry, immuno-electron microscopy imaging, and action potential recording, we assessed the effect of loss of Carm1 function on cardiomyocyte cell growth, myofibril expansion, T-tubule formation, and electrophysiological maturation. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling, H3R17me2a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing were used to investigate the mechanisms by which CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) regulates cardiomyocyte maturation. Finally, we interrogated the human syntenic region to the H3R17me2a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing peaks for single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human heart diseases. RESULTS: We report that mosaic ablation of Carm1 disrupts multiple aspects of cardiomyocyte maturation cell autonomously, leading to reduced cardiomyocyte size and sarcomere thickness, severe loss and disorganization of T tubules, and compromised electrophysiological maturation. Genomics study demonstrates that CARM1 directly activates genes that underlie cardiomyocyte cytoarchitectural and electrophysiological maturation.

Utilizing an in vivo mosaic knockout system, we aim to elucidate how loss of Carm1 function affects cardiomyocyte growth, myofibril expansion, T-tubule formation, and electrophysiological maturation. Our preliminary findings suggest that Carm1 is crucial for these aspects of cardiomyocyte development, and its absence leads to significant structural and functional impairments. Furthermore, our genomic analyses indicate that CARM1 activates key genes involved in cardiomyocyte maturation, and deregulation of these genes may be linked to human heart diseases. This research could provide valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of cardiomyocyte maturation and its implications for cardiac health."

They may be useful in many respects, the AD models; however, they are not. First, they are incapable of developing the full spectrum of the AD pathology. Second, they respond spectacularly well to drugs that are completely ineffective in the treatment of symptomatic AD. These observations indicate that both the transgenic animal models and the drugs faithfully reflect the theory that guided the design and development of both, the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH), and that both are inadequate because their underlying theory is. This conclusion necessitated the formulation of a new, all-encompassing theory of conventional AD—the ACH2.0. The two principal attributes of the ACH2.0 are the following. One, in conventional AD, the agent that causes the disease and drives its pathology is the intraneuronal amyloid-β (iAβ) produced in two distinctly different pathways. Two, following the commencement of AD, the bulk of Aβ is generated independently of Aβ protein precursor (AβPP) and is retained inside the neuron as iAβ. Within the framework of the ACH2.0, AβPP-derived iAβ accumulates physiologically in a lifelong process. It cannot reach levels required to support the progression of AD; it does, however, cause the disease. Indeed, conventional AD occurs if and when the levels of AβPP-derived iAβ cross the critical threshold, elicit the neuronal integrated stress response (ISR), and trigger the activation of the AβPP-independent iAβ generation pathway; the disease commences only when this pathway is operational. The iAβ produced in this pathway reaches levels sufficient to drive the AD pathology; it also propagates its own production and thus sustains the activity of the pathway and perpetuates its operation. The present study analyzes the reason underlying the evident inadequacy of the current transgenic animal models of AD. It concludes that they model, in fact, not Alzheimer’s disease but rather the effects of the neuronal ISR sustained by AβPP-derived iAβ, that this is due to the lack of the operational AβPP-independent iAβ production pathway, and that this mechanism must be incorporated into any successful AD model faithfully emulating the disease. The study dissects the plausible molecular mechanisms of the AβPP-independent iAβ production and the pathways leading to their activation, and introduces the concept of conventional versus unconventional Alzheimer’s disease. It also proposes the path forward, posits the principles of design of productive transgenic animal models of the disease, and describes the molecular details of their construction.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10932000', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25052981', 'CorpusId': 268303722, 'PubMed': '38474228'}",1,"Given that existing transgenic animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) fail to develop the full spectrum of AD pathology and respond well to ineffective drugs, it is evident that these models are based on an inadequate theory, the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH). This necessitates the formulation of a new theory, ACH2.0, which posits that intraneuronal amyloid-β (iAβ) produced through two distinct pathways is the causative agent driving AD pathology. ACH2.0 suggests that conventional AD begins when AβPP-derived iAβ crosses a critical threshold, triggering an independent iAβ production pathway that sustains and propagates disease progression. The study highlights the need for new transgenic animal models incorporating this dual-pathway mechanism to accurately emulate AD, proposing a comprehensive framework for their design and construction, and distinguishing between conventional and unconventional forms of Alzheimer's disease."

G4s form from G-rich sequences across the genome, whose biased distribution in regulatory regions points towards a gene-regulatory role. G4s can themselves be regulated by helicases, such as DHX36 (aliases: G4R1 and RHAU), which possess the necessary activity to resolve these stable structures. G4s have been shown to both positively and negatively regulate gene expression when stabilized by ligands, or through the loss of helicase activity. Using DHX36 knockout Jurkat cell lines, we identified widespread, although often subtle, effects on gene expression that are associated with the presence or number of observed G-quadruplexes in promoters or gene regions. Genes that significantly change their expression, particularly those that show a significant increase in RNA abundance under DHX36 knockout, are associated with a range of cellular functions and processes, including numerous transcription factors and oncogenes, and are linked to several cancers.

The study utilizing DHX36 knockout Jurkat cell lines reveals that the disruption of DHX36 leads to subtle yet widespread changes in gene expression, particularly increasing RNA abundance in genes associated with transcription factors, oncogenes, and various cellular functions. These findings underscore the crucial role of DHX36 in maintaining gene expression balance and suggest that its dysregulation may contribute to oncogenic processes, highlighting the importance of further research into G4s and DHX36 as targets in cancer biology."

Patients with AIS are characterized by abnormal skeletal growth and reduced bone mineral density. The etiology of AIS is thought to be multifactorial, involving both environmental and genetic factors, but to date, it is still unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to further investigate the molecular pathogenesis of AIS and to identify biomarkers useful for predicting curve progression. In this perspective, the relative abundance of a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) was analyzed in the plasma of 20 AIS patients and 10 healthy controls (HC). The data revealed a significant group of circulating miRNAs dysregulated in AIS patients compared to HC. Further bioinformatic analyses evidenced a more restricted expression of some miRNAs exclusively in severe AIS females. These include some members of the miR-30 family, which are considered promising regulators for treating bone diseases. We demonstrated circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from severe AIS females contained miR-30 family members and decreased the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Proteomic analysis of EVs highlighted the expression of proteins associated with orthopedic disease. This study provides preliminary evidence of a miRNAs signature potentially associated with severe female AIS and suggests the corresponding vesicular component may affect cellular mechanisms crucial in AIS, opening the scenario for in-depth studies on prognostic differences related to gender and grade.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10779108', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25010570', 'CorpusId': 266732927, 'PubMed': '38203740'}",1,"Given that Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal disorder in adolescents characterized by abnormal skeletal growth and reduced bone mineral density, this study aims to explore the molecular pathogenesis and potential biomarkers predictive of disease progression.

Here, we show deposition of one RNA modification-N2-methylguanosine (m2G) on the G72 of U6 snRNA (the catalytic center of the spliceosome) promotes efficient pre-mRNA splicing activity in human cells. This modification was identified to be conserved among vertebrates. Further, THUMPD2 was demonstrated as the methyltransferase responsible for U6 m2G72 by explicitly recognizing the U6-specific sequences and structural elements. The knock-out of THUMPD2 eliminated U6 m2G72 and impaired the pre-mRNA splicing activity, resulting in thousands of changed alternative splicing events of endogenous pre-mRNAs in human cells. Notably, the aberrantly spliced pre-mRNA population elicited the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. We further show that THUMPD2 was associated with age-related macular degeneration and retinal function. Our study thus demonstrates how an RNA epigenetic modification of the major spliceosome regulates global pre-mRNA splicing and impacts physiology and disease.",2024,Nucleic Acids Research,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '11014329', 'DOI': '10.1093/nar/gkad1243', 'CorpusId': 266724860, 'PubMed': '38165050'}",1,"Given that the spliceosome is a relatively conserved complex managing a vast number of splicing events in humans compared to yeast, this study explores the role of an RNA modification, N2-methylguanosine (m2G) at position G72 of U6 snRNA, in enhancing pre-mRNA splicing efficiency in human cells. The research identifies THUMPD2 as the methyltransferase responsible for this modification, which is conserved among vertebrates.

Chronic inflammation and increased disease severity in viral infections are the hallmarks of the obesity-related immunopathology. The upregulation of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSM2) has shown to be associated with the pathology of obesity in tissues. Nevertheless, the role of sphingolipids and specifically of NSM2 in the regulation of immune cell response to a fatty acid (FA) rich environment is poorly studied. Here, we identified the presence of the LD marker protein perilipin 3 (PLIN3) in the intracellular nano-environment of NSM2 using the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2-catalyzed proximity-dependent biotin labeling method. In line with this, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) shows NSM2 and PLIN3 co-localization in LD organelles in the presence of increased extracellular concentrations of oleic acid (OA). Furthermore, the association of enzymatically active NSM2 with isolated LDs correlates with increased Cer levels in these lipid storage organelles. NSM2 enzymatic activity is not required for NSM2 association with LDs, but negatively affects the LD numbers and cellular accumulation of long-chain unsaturated triacylglycerol (TAG) species. Concurrently, NSM2 expression promotes mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to increased OA levels, thereby shifting cells to a high energetic state. Importantly, endogenous NSM2 activity is crucial for primary human CD4+ T cell survival and proliferation in a FA rich environment. To conclude, our study shows a novel NSM2 intracellular localization to LDs and the role of enzymatically active NSM2 in metabolic response to enhanced FA concentrations in T cells.",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,['JournalArticle'],"{'PubMedCentral': '10970209', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms25063247', 'CorpusId': 268466092, 'PubMed': '38542220'}",1,"Given that the accumulation of lipid droplets and ceramides is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and associated metabolic and immune dysfunctions, our research aims to explore the role of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSM2) in regulating immune cell response in fatty acid-rich environments.

A. rabiei infection can cause severe damage in chickpea, resulting in significant economic losses. Understanding the resistance mechanism against ascochyta blight can help to define strategies to develop resistant cultivars. In this study, differentially expressed genes from two partially resistant cultivars (CDC Corinne and CDC Luna) and a susceptible cultivar (ICCV 96029) to ascochyta blight were identified in the early stages (24, 48 and 72 h) of A. rabiei infection using RNA-seq. Altogether, 3073 genes were differentially expressed in response to A. rabiei infection across different time points and cultivars. A larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in CDC Corinne and CDC Luna than in ICCV 96029. Various transcription factors including ERF, WRKY, bHLH and MYB were differentially expressed in response to A. rabiei infection. Genes involved in pathogen detection and immune signalings such as receptor-like kinases (RLKs), Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR)-RLKs, and genes associated with the post-infection defence response were differentially expressed among the cultivars. GO functional enrichment and pathway analysis of the DEGs suggested that the biological processes such as metabolic process, response to stimulus and catalytic activity were overrepresented in both resistant and susceptible chickpea cultivars.

In the present study, 27 GhANNs were identified in cotton and were unevenly distributed across 14 chromosomes. Transcriptome data and RT-qPCR results revealed that multiple GhANNs respond to at least two abiotic stresses. Similarly, the expression levels of GhANN4 and GhANN11 were significantly upregulated under heat, cold, and drought stress. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), functional characterization of GhANN4 and GhANN11 revealed that, compared with those of the controls, the leaf wilting of GhANN4-silenced plants was more obvious, and the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were lower under NaCl and PEG stress. Moreover, the expression of stress marker genes (GhCBL3, GhDREB2A, GhDREB2C, GhPP2C, GhRD20-2, GhCIPK6, GhNHX1, GhRD20-1, GhSOS1, GhSOS2 and GhSnRK2.6) was significantly downregulated in GhANN4-silenced plants after stress. Under cold stress, the growth of the GHANN11-silenced plants was significantly weaker than that of the control plants, and the activities of POD, SOD, and CAT were also lower. However, compared with those of the control, the elasticity and orthostatic activity of the GhANN11-silenced plants were greater; the POD, SOD, and CAT activities were higher; and the GhDREB2C, GhHSP, and GhSOS2 expression levels were greater under heat stress.

It is associated with low survival rates despite existing treatments, indicating that new and more effective therapies are urgently needed such as the chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy. The cell-surface glucose-regulated protein 78 (csGRP78) is expressed in various hematological malignancies and solid tumor cells including lung cancer in response to cancer-related endoplasmic reticulum stress, while GRP78 is restricted to inside the normal cells. Here, we detected the prominent expression of csGRP78 in both lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H1299, as well as cancer stemlike cells derived from A549 by immunofluorescence. Next, a csGRP78-targeted CAR was constructed, and the transduced CAR-T cells were tested for their potency to kill the two lung cancer cell lines and derived stemlike cells, which was correlated with specific interferon γ release in vitro. Finally, we found that csGRP78 CAR-T cells also efficiently killed both lung cancer cells and cancer stemlike cells, resulting into the elimination of tumor xenografts in vivo, neither with any evidence of relapse after 63 days of tumor clearance nor any detrimental impact on other body organs we examined.

The hallmark pathological feature of PD is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to the formation of intracellular aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Recent data evidenced how disruptions in protein synthesis, folding, and degradation are events commonly observed in PD and may provide information on the molecular background behind its etiopathogenesis. In the present study, we used a publicly available transcriptomic microarray dataset of peripheral blood of PD patients and healthy controls (GSE6613) to investigate the potential dysregulation of elements involved in proteostasis-related processes at the transcriptomic level.

This study aimed to assess CA’s impact on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, the gut microbiota, and metabolites. Mice were induced with 2.5% DSS to develop colitis over a 7-day period. CA was administered intragastrically one week prior to DSS treatment and continued for 14 days. The microbial composition in the stool was determined using 16S rRNA sequencing, while non-targeted metabolomics was employed to analyze the metabolic profiles of each mouse group. The results show that CA effectively alleviated colitis, as evidenced by an increased colon length, lowered disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores, and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression levels. CA intervention restored the structure of gut microbiota. Specifically, it decreased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria at the phylum level and Bacteroides, Rosiarcus, and unclassified Xanthobacteraceae at the genus level, and increased the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae at the genus level. Metabolomic analysis revealed that CA supplementation reversed the up-regulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and N-acetylneuraminic acid, as well as the down-regulation of phloroglucinol, thiamine, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, lithocholic acid, and oxymatrine induced by DSS.

Although word prediction is an important mechanism underlying language processing, human language comprehension occurs at multiple levels, involving the integration of words and sentences to achieve a full understanding of discourse. This study models language comprehension by using the next sentence prediction (NSP) task to investigate mechanisms of discourse-level comprehension. We show that NSP pretraining enhanced a model’s alignment with brain data especially in the right hemisphere and in the multiple demand network, highlighting the contributions of nonclassical language regions to high-level language understanding. Our results also suggest that NSP can enable the model to better capture human comprehension performance and to better encode contextual information.

In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people.

Despite overall declines in cancer mortality due to reduced smoking rates, early detection, and improved treatments, gains are threatened by rising incidences and persistent disparities in cancer outcomes among racial and ethnic groups. Specifically, Black and Native American populations face disproportionately higher mortality rates for certain cancers. To sustain and enhance national progress in combating cancer, it is crucial to invest in comprehensive cancer prevention strategies and ensure equitable access to treatment, with a focus on vulnerable populations such as American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black individuals."

There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7%), followed by colorectal (9.3%), liver (7.8%), female breast (6.9%), and stomach (6.8%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four‐fold to five‐fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South‐Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics‐based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.",2024,Ca,372,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.3322/caac.21834', 'CorpusId': 268886842, 'PubMed': '38572751'}",2,"Given that global cancer statistics for the year 2022 revealed nearly 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million deaths, this study highlights the significant burden of cancer worldwide and underscores the importance of targeted prevention strategies.

The authors emphasize the role of demographic factors and key risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and infections, in driving these trends. They argue that strategic investments in cancer prevention could significantly reduce future cancer diagnoses and deaths, yielding considerable economic and societal benefits by 2050."

Here, have we demonstrated that freshly isolated mouse and human NK cells express low levels of the endo-b-D-glucuronidase heparanase that increase upon NK cell activation. Heparanase deficiency did not affect development, differentiation, or tissue localization of NK cells under steady-state conditions. However, mice lacking heparanase specifically in NK cells (Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice) were highly tumor prone when challenged with the carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA). Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice were also more susceptible to tumor growth than were their littermate controls when challenged with the established mouse lymphoma cell line RMA-S-RAE-1b, which overexpresses the NK cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand RAE-1b, or when inoculated with metastatic melanoma, prostate carcinoma, or mammary carcinoma cell lines. NK cell invasion of primary tumors and recruitment to the site of metastasis were strictly dependent on the presence of heparanase. Cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases was compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor progression and metastases. This should be considered when systemically treating cancer patients with heparanase inhibitors, since the potential adverse effect on NK cell infiltration might limit the antitumor activity of the inhibitors.

To address this limitation, we investigated if convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which scale linearly with sequence length, could be as effective as transformers in protein language models. With masked language model pretraining, CNNs are competitive to and occasionally superior to Transformers across downstream applications while maintaining strong performance on sequences longer than those allowed in the current state-of-the-art Transformer models.

However, the existing Transformer brings two critical challenges for applying it in large-area earth observation scenes: (1) redundant token representation due to most irrelevant tokens; (2) single-scale representation which ignores scale correlation modeling of similar ground observation targets. To this end, this paper proposes to adaptively eliminate the interference of irreverent tokens for a more compact self-attention calculation. Specifically, we devise a Residual Token Selective Group (RTSG) to grasp the most crucial token by dynamically selecting the top- $k$ keys in terms of score ranking for each query. For better feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Feed-forward Layer (MFL) is developed to generate an enriched representation of multi-scale feature mixtures during feed-forward process. Moreover, we also proposed a Global Context Attention (GCA) to fully explore the most informative components, thus introducing more inductive bias to the RTSG for an accurate reconstruction. In particular, multiple cascaded RTSGs form our final Top- $k$ Token Selective Transformer (TTST) to achieve progressive representation. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world remote sensing datasets demonstrate our TTST could perform favorably against state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Lp(a) levels are genetically pre-determined, with LPA gene encoding for two apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] isoforms. Isoform size variations are driven by the number of kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) repeats. Lp(a) levels are inversely correlated with isoform size. In this study, we examined the role of Lp(a) levels, apo(a) size and inflammatory markers with lower extremity revascularization outcomes. Methods: 25 subjects with chronic peripheral arterial disease (PAD), underwent open or endovascular lower extremity revascularization (mean age of 66.7 {+/-} 9.7 years; F=12, M=13; Black=8, Hispanic=5, and White=12). Pre- and post-operative medical history, self-reported symptoms, ankle brachial indices (ABIs), and lower extremity duplex ultrasounds were obtained. Plasma Lp(a), apoB100, lipid panel, and pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-18, hs-CRP, TNF) were assayed preoperatively. Isoform size was estimated using gel electrophoresis and weighted isoform size (wIS) calculated based on % isoform expression. Firth logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between Lp(a) levels, and wIS with procedural outcomes: symptoms (better/worse), primary patency at 2-4 weeks, ABIs, and re-intervention within 3-6 months. We controlled for age, sex, history of diabetes, smoking, statin, antiplatelet and anticoagulation use. Results: Median plasma Lp(a) level was 108 (44, 301) nmol/L. The mean apoB100 level was 168.0 {+/-} 65.8 mg/dL. These values were not statistically different among races. We found no association between Lp(a) levels and wIS with measured plasma pro-inflammatory markers. However, smaller apo(a) wIS was associated with occlusion of the treated lesion(s) in the postoperative period [OR=1.97 (95% CI 1.01 - 3.86, p<0.05)]. The relationship of smaller apo(a) wIS with re-intervention was not as strong [OR=1.57 (95% CI 0.96 - 2.56), p=0.07]. We observed no association between wIS with patient reported symptoms or change in ABIs. Conclusions: In this small study, subjects with smaller apo(a) isoform size undergoing peripheral arterial revascularization were more likely to experience occlusion in the perioperative period and/or require re-intervention. Larger cohort studies identifying the mechanism and validating these preliminary data are needed to improve understanding of long-term peripheral vascular outcomes.",2024,medRxiv,26,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1519/JSC.0000000000002618', 'CorpusId': 44095924, 'PubMed': '38562737'}",2,"Given that high lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels are genetically determined and associated with adverse limb events in patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, our research proposes to investigate the role of Lp(a) levels, apo(a) isoform size, and inflammatory markers on the outcomes of such procedures. This study examined 25 subjects with chronic peripheral arterial disease, assessing various pre- and post-operative parameters including medical history, symptoms, ABIs, and lower extremity ultrasounds. The findings indicate that smaller apo(a) isoform size is associated with a higher likelihood of occlusion of the treated lesion(s) postoperatively and potentially more frequent re-interventions. However, no significant associations were found between Lp(a) levels and inflammatory markers. These preliminary results suggest that apo(a) isoform size could be a critical factor in peripheral vascular outcomes, warranting further investigation in larger cohort studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and validate these findings."

Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model, DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules, we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance in the sampling phase. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties and conformational stability, with up to -8.39 Avg.

Concurrently, AlphaFold2 broke through in protein structure prediction. Now we can systematically and comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act and exist as three-dimensional (3D) machines and evolve as linear strings of one-dimensional (1D) sequences. Here, we leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities by combining 1D sequences with 3D structure in a single model. We encode protein structures as token sequences using the 3Di-alphabet introduced by the 3D-alignment method Foldseek. This new foundation pLM extracts the features and patterns of the resulting “structure-sequence” representation. Toward this end, we built a non-redundant dataset from AlphaFoldDB and fine-tuned an existing pLM (ProtT5) to translate between 3Di and amino acid sequences. As a proof-of-concept for our novel approach, dubbed Protein structure-sequence T5 (ProstT5), we showed improved performance for subsequent prediction tasks, and for “inverse folding”, namely the generation of novel protein sequences adopting a given structural scaffold (“fold”). Our work showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by AlphaFold2. ProstT5 paves the way to develop new tools integrating the vast resource of 3D predictions, and opens new research avenues in the post-AlphaFold2 era.

We start from the assumption that LLMs, inadvertently yet inevitably, acquire psychological traits (metaphorically speaking) from the vast text corpora on which they are trained. Such corpora contain sediments of the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases of the countless human authors of these texts, which LLMs learn through a complex training process. The traits that LLMs acquire in such a way can potentially influence their behavior, that is, their outputs in downstream tasks and applications in which they are employed, which in turn may have real-world consequences for individuals and social groups. By eliciting LLMs' responses to language-based psychometric inventories, we can bring their traits to light. Psychometric profiling enables researchers to study and compare LLMs in terms of noncognitive characteristics, thereby providing a window into the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases these models exhibit (or mimic). We discuss the history of similar ideas and outline possible psychometric approaches for LLMs. We demonstrate one promising approach, zero-shot classification, for several LLMs and psychometric inventories. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and future avenues of research for AI Psychometrics.",2024,Perspectives on Psychological Science,22,['JournalArticle'],"{'DOI': '10.1177/17456916231214460', 'CorpusId': 266741401, 'PubMed': '38165766'}",2,"Given that large language models (LLMs) inadvertently acquire psychological traits from the vast text corpora they are trained on, there is a compelling need to repurpose standard psychometric inventories for their evaluation.

By applying psychometric profiling, researchers can better understand and compare LLMs, potentially uncovering how these acquired traits influence their outputs and subsequent real-world impacts. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using zero-shot classification for this purpose and highlights both the challenges and future research directions in the emerging field of AI Psychometrics."

In this work, we develop a flow-based generative modeling approach for learning and sampling the conformational landscapes of proteins. We repurpose highly accurate single-state predictors such as AlphaFold and ESMFold and fine-tune them under a custom flow matching framework to obtain sequence-conditoned generative models of protein structure called AlphaFlow and ESMFlow. When trained and evaluated on the PDB, our method provides a superior combination of precision and diversity compared to AlphaFold with MSA subsampling. When further trained on ensembles from all-atom MD, our method accurately captures conformational flexibility, positional distributions, and higher-order ensemble observables for unseen proteins. Moreover, our method can diversify a static PDB structure with faster wall-clock convergence to certain equilibrium properties than replicate MD trajectories, demonstrating its potential as a proxy for expensive physics-based simulations.
